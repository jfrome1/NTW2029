Content topic: catch-up day to review anything we missedâ€”bring your questions!

- Read before class: review Pinker, Boyd, Austin, and Dutton (bring to class)

Writing topic: explicating and analyzing arguments

- Read before class: _The Craft of Research_, chapter 7 "Making Good Arguments"
	- the concept of "warrant" in this chapter can be confusing; you can think of warrants more simply as assumptions someone relies on while making their argument
