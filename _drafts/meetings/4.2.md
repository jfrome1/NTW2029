Content topic: art and sexual selection

- Read before class: "Art and Human Self-Domestication" from Dutton, Denis,  _The Art Instinct: Beauty, Pleasure, & Human Evolution_. New York, NY: Bloomsbury Press, 2009. [135-63](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/users/90279/files/3681674/download?verifier=sGqFplFszpOq1vTcQWh4QzX0O7rGbcIXeLAEZa1i&download_frd=1).
	- You can skim 135-144, which covers topics we have already discussed.
	- Discussion questions:
		- On p. 139, there is a sentence beginning "It is human intelligence..." that contains the word "art". Which of the two senses of "art" is Dutton using here?
		- How many sections are in this article? Can you summarize the main point of each section?
		- What is the main argument of this chapter? How does each section support that argument (if it does)? Do the sections depend on each other?

Writing topics: paragraph structure, sentence structure

- Read before class (recommended): _The Craft of Research_  Chapter 17, "Revising Style: Telling Your Story Clearly"
