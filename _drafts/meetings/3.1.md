Content topic: Criticisms of EP

- Read before class: ยง2.7 "Methodological Objections"  from Goldfinch, Andrew. _Rethinking Evolutionary Psychology_. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015. [62-71](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/users/90279/files/3681669/download?verifier=uc1hTASjwaB5LOi7cCQFjLh39JarlG42fkzWSwoX&download_frd=1)
- Discussion questions:
	- What is the author's attitude towards the arguments he presents? Can you tell if Goldfinch agrees with the arguments or not? How?
	- Each section of the reading contains a different argument challenging EP. Can you summarize each argument in one or two sentences?
	- Consider the EP arguments we have discussed so far in class. Are the arguments proposed in the readings effective challenges to these EP arguments?

Writing topic: elements of the essay

- Read before class (recommended): none

<!-- check later if I want to use the NUSC "Common Terms in Argumentative Writing or Harvey's _Elements of the Essay_ -->
