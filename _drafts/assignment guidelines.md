title: Assignment guidelines
---
In this course, you will frequently submit assignments to practice skills necessary for writing academic papers. Sometimes assignments are assigned in groups, but they are not group writing assignments. Each student should individually write their own submission.

Assignments must follow formatting and GenAI guidelines.

Writing guidelines:

- grammatically correct
- language is as simple and concise as possible (no big words unless really necessary)
- understandable by a reader who has not read the source text

Many of these assignments will require you to explain the argument of a source. In these cases, follow these guidelines unless otherwise specified:

- convey the main ideas of the text
- do not use any quotes from the text (it is ok to quote individual words or phrases that are key terms of the argument)
- attribute all the claims to the source author, like this: "Dunbar et. al. states that..." or "Badcock states that Darwin makes two main points..."
- balance two goals: condensing and expanding
	- condense sources by presenting only selected ideas and details to convey the key ideas from those sources
	- expand sources by explaining terms, ideas, and implications of the argument to non-expert audiences who don't have the background needed to understand the argument as originally written

Assignments are designed to take 90 min or less to complete, including reading time. Please do not spend more than 2 hours on an assignment.

Assignments do not need introductions or conclusions.

I will bring hardcopies of some assignments to class to discuss as a group. While at first it may be uncomfortable to discuss your writing in public, the process is incredibly useful. If you do not want me to ever use your summaries in class, let me know.

Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the friendly, non-judgmental tutors at the Writer's Center. Book an appointment with a peer tutor here: https://nus.mywconline.com/.
