title: Papers
---

Paper 1 asks students to respond to an argument from one of the assigned readings; Paper 2 asks students to contribute to an academic discussion about art and evolution using multiple sources.

Both papers will have students submit proposals, outlines, and/or drafts for instructor and peer feedback to make sure students have enough guidance to produce successful work.

Explicit guidance and grading criteria will be provided in class and elsewhere on the course website.

<summary>Respond to my paper feedback.
</summary>

- I will provide feedback on assignments leading up to the final draft of your two main papers. When grading the final, I often notice problems that I remember mentioning in conferences or as written feedback on previous assignments.
- If I mention something to improve in your paper, take great care to respond to my comment. There are probably perfectly innocent reasons students might not address certain comments, such as running out of time or not knowing how to address the comment. From an instructor's perspective, however, if I take the time to provide a piece of feedback, and you don't make any changes, it is easy to think it means that you don't think my feedback is important, you don't care if you get a good grade, or you don't appreciate my efforts to help you.
