## Purpose

This exercise helps you select a suitable pair of articles for Paper 2.

## Overview

Submit a brief proposal identifying your target article, commentary article, and the main criticism you plan to analyze. Commentary articles typically make several different criticisms, so you'll identify one main criticism to focus on.

Note: Since you will discuss each other's topics in detail during peer review, I'd like all students in each section to write about different article pairs. I don't think this will be an issue, and I'm ok if a few students choose the same pair of articles but write about different criticisms. However, if by some weird coincidence everyone chooses the same articles and criticisms, I may ask some students for a 2nd choice.

## Requirements

Your proposal must include:

1. **Target article** - Which of the four BBS target articles you've chosen
2. **Commentary article** - Which commentary you've selected from the recommended list below
3. **Main criticism** - Which specific criticism from the commentary you plan to focus on for Paper 2 (you can change this later). 1-2 sentences is fine.

That's it. This is intended to be a short assignment.

## Guidelines

### Choosing Your Commentary

For each target article, I've provided recommended commentaries below. These commentaries have been vetted for:

- **Substantial criticism** (not minor clarifications or supportive additions)
- **Accurate representation** of the target article (not strawman arguments)
- **Clear argumentation** with multiple criticisms you can choose among

You may choose any commentary from the same BBS issue, but the recommended commentaries below are more likely to work well for Paper 2.

**Note:** Even within recommended commentaries, some criticisms will be stronger than others. Use P05 to verify your chosen criticism is suitable before proceeding to P06.

### Focus and Scope

Commentary articles typically make several different criticisms. For this paper, focus on ONE main criticism. (You may discuss related arguments if they support your analysis, but maintain focus on a central criticism.)

Identify which specific criticism from the commentary you plan to analyze. Don't try to address everything the commentary says.

### What to Avoid

**Avoid commentaries that misrepresent the target article** (i.e., criticize a strawman). Different interpretations are fine, but if the commentary attributes a claim to the target that the target doesn't actually make, you'll have difficulty writing a meaningful analysis. P05 helps you check for this.

**Avoid obviously weak arguments.** It might seem easier to choose a commentary that makes a bad argument (less ambiguity about who's right could make the paper faster to write), but weak arguments will actually make your paper harder to write. They limit the depth of analysis you can do and reduce the significance of your contribution to the academic conversation, which affects your grade.

**Choose a criticism substantial enough to analyze in depth.** If the commentary's criticism is trivial or tangential to the target article's main argument, you won't have enough material for meaningful analysis.

## Recommended Commentaries

### Target Article 1: Dubourg & Baumard (2022) - Why Imaginary Worlds?

*Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e276: 1-72  
Main article: pp. 1-18  
Author's response: p. 63

**Recommended commentaries:**

1. **Beck, S. R., & Harris, P. L.** (2022). "The development of the imagination and imaginary worlds." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e278 (pp. 19-20)

   **Abstract:** Evidence from developmental psychology on children's imagination is currently too limited to support Dubourg and Baumard's proposal and, in several respects, it is inconsistent with their proposal. Although children have impressive imaginative powers, we highlight the complexity of the developmental trajectory as well as the close connections between children's imagination and reality.

2. **Dunk, R., & Mar, R. A.** (2022). "Cognitive exploration drives engagement and re-engagement with imaginary worlds, but not spatial exploration as predicted by evolutionary theory." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e281 (pp. 24-25)

   **Abstract:** The empirical evidence for exploration underlying the appeal of imaginary worlds is mostly absent or contradictory. Openness, and the cognitive exploration it represents, provides a better account than the overall drive to explore predicted by evolutionary theory. Furthermore, exploration cannot explain why imaginary worlds foster frequent re-engagement.

3. **Llewellyn, S.** (2022). "'Never Land': Where do imaginary worlds come from?" *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e287 (pp. 30-31)

   **Abstract:** We assume "Imaginary worlds" to be unreal and unfamiliar: high fantasy. I argue they are real and familiar to authors because they comprise memory elements, which blend experience, knowledge, beliefs and pre-occupations. These "bits and pieces" from memories can generate a world, which readers experience as pure imagination. I illustrate using J.M. Barrie's "Never Land" and J.R.R. Tolkien's "Middle-Earth."

4. **Norman, K. E., & Goldstein, T. R.** (2022). "All non-real worlds provide exploration: Evidence from developmental psychology." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e290 (pp. 36-37)

   **Abstract:** While Dubourg and Baumard argue that predisposition toward exploration draws us to fictional environments, they fail to answer their titular question: "Why Imaginary Worlds?" Research in pretend play, psychological distancing, and theatre shows that being "imaginary" (i.e., any type of unreal, rather than only fantastically unreal) makes exploration of any fictional world profoundly different than that of real-life unfamiliar environments.

5. **Nyhout, A., & Lee, R.** (2022). "Young children are not driven to explore imaginary worlds." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e291 (pp. 37-38)

   **Abstract:** We address Dubourg and Baumard's claim that imaginary worlds are most appealing early in the lifespan when the exploratory drive is highest. Preschool-age children prefer fictions set in the real world, and fantastical information can be difficult for children to represent in real time. We speculate that a drive to explore imaginary worlds may emerge after children acquire substantial real-world skills and knowledge. An account of age effects on fictional preferences should encompass developmental change.

### Target Article 2: Menninghaus et al. (2017) - Negative Emotions in Art

*Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40, e347: 1-63  
Main article: pp. 1-15  
Author's response: p. 58

**Recommended commentaries:**

1. **Bullot, N. J., & Reber, R.** (2017). "Artistic misunderstandings: The emotional significance of historical learning in the arts." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40, e354 (pp. 17-18)

   **Abstract:** The Distancing-Embracing model does not have the conceptual resources to explain artistic misunderstandings and the emotional consequences of historical learning in the arts. Specifically, it suggests implausible predictions about emotional distancing caused by art schemata (e.g., misunderstandings of artistic intentions and contexts). These problems show the need for further inquiries into how historical contextualization modulates negative emotions in the arts.

2. **Konečni, V. J.** (2017). "'Negative emotions' live in stories, not in the hearts of readers who enjoy them." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40, e367 (pp. 28-29)

   **Abstract:** The commendably ambitious project by Menninghaus et al. fails because its main connective tissue — "negative emotions" — is beyond the grasp of the authors' largely literary approach. The critique focuses on their treatment of the Paradox of Fiction, the neglect of the biological, adaptive nature of emotions, and the absence of convincing empirical support for key aspects of the proposed model.

3. **Nadal, M., Vartanian, O., & Skov, M.** (2017). "Psychological models of art reception must be empirically grounded." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40, e371 (pp. 30-31)

   **Abstract:** We commend Menninghaus et al. for tackling the role of negative emotions in art reception. However, their model suffers from shortcomings that reduce its applicability to empirical studies of the arts: poor use of evidence, lack of integration with other models, and limited derivation of testable hypotheses. We argue that theories about art experiences should be based on empirical evidence.

4. **Schubert, T. W., Seibt, B., Zickfeld, J. H., Blomster, J. K., & Fiske, A. P.** (2017). "Being moved is a positive emotion, and emotions should not be equated with their vernacular labels." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40, e374 (pp. 33-34)

   **Abstract:** As evidence for the second process of the Embracing factor, the target article characterizes being moved as a mixed emotion linked to sadness through metonymy. We question these characterizations and argue that emotions should not be equated with their vernacular labels.

5. **Van De Cruys, S., Chamberlain, R., & Wagemans, J.** (2017). "Tuning in to art: A predictive processing account of negative emotion in art." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40, e377 (pp. 36-37)

   **Abstract:** We use the example of art-derived solace to discuss a broader mechanism by which negative affect is instrumental in creating positive appreciation of artworks. Based on the theory of predictive processing, we argue that increasing attunement or reduction of prediction errors, which implies increasing validation of the agents (models), is experienced as positive, even if the artwork's content is negative.

### Target Article 3: Savage et al. (2021) - Music as Social Bonding

*Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e59: 1-77  
Main article: pp. 1-22  
Author's response: p. 61

**Recommended commentaries:**

1. **Fritz, J. B.** (2021). "Is the MSB hypothesis (music as a coevolved system for social bonding) testable in the Popperian sense?" *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e70 (pp. 53-54)

   **Abstract:** "Music As a Coevolved System for Social Bonding" (MSB) is a brilliant synthesis and appealing hypothesis offering insights into the evolution and social bonding of musicality, but is so broad and sweeping it will be challenging to test, prove or falsify in the Popperian sense (Popper, 1959). After general comments, I focus my critique on underlying neurobiological mechanisms, and offer some suggestions for experimental tests of MSB.

2. **Verpooten, J., & Eens, M.** (2021). "Singing is not associated with social complexity across species." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e92 (pp. 89-90)

   **Abstract:** Based on their social bonding hypothesis, Savage et al. predict a relation between "musical" behaviors and social complexity across species. However, our qualitative comparative review suggests that, although learned contact calls are positively associated with complex social dynamics across species, songs are not. Yet, in contrast to songs, and arguably consistent with their functions, contact calls are not particularly music-like.

3. **Wood, C.** (2021). "Musical bonds are orthogonal to symbolic language and norms." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e119 (pp. 59-60)

   **Abstract:** Both Mehr et al.'s credible signaling hypothesis and Savage et al.'s music and social bonding hypothesis emphasize the role of multilevel social structures in the evolution of music. Although empirical evidence preferentially supports the social bonding hypothesis, rhythmic music may enable bonding in a way uniquely fitted to the normative and language-based character of multilevel human societies.

   **Note:** This commentary addresses both Savage et al. and Mehr et al. It is listed under both target articles. If you choose this commentary with Savage as your target article, focus on what it says about the music and social bonding hypothesis.

### Target Article 4: Mehr et al. (2021) - Music as Credible Signaling

*Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e60: 1-87  
Main article: pp. 1-23  
Author's response: p. 69

**Recommended commentaries:**

1. **Killin, A., Brusse, C., Currie, A., & Planer, R. J.** (2021). "Not by signalling alone: Music's mosaicism undermines the search for a proper function." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e103 (pp. 107-108)

   **Abstract:** Mehr et al. seek to explain music's evolution in terms of a unitary proper function — signalling cooperative intent — which they cash out in two guises, coalition signalling and (allo)parental attention signalling. Although we recognize the role signalling almost certainly played in the evolution of music, we reject "ultimate" causal explanations which focus on a unidirectional, narrow range of causal factors.

2. **Pinker, S.** (2021). "Sex and drugs and rock and roll." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e109 (pp. 115-116)

   **Abstract:** This article is extraordinarily rigorous and rich, although there are reasons to be skeptical of its theory that music originated to signal group quality and infant solicitude. These include the lack of any signature of the centrality of these functions in the distribution or experience of music; of a role for the pleasure taken in music; and of its connections with language.

3. **Stewart-Williams, S.** (2021). "Making music: Let's not be too quick to abandon the byproduct hypothesis." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e113 (pp. 120-121)

   **Abstract:** It is premature to conclude that music is an adaptation. Given the danger of overextending the adaptationist mode of explanation, the default position should be the byproduct hypothesis, and it should take very strong evidence to drag us into the adaptationist camp. As yet, the evidence isn't strong enough — and the proposed adaptationist explanations have a number of unresolved difficulties.

4. **Wood, C.** (2021). "Musical bonds are orthogonal to symbolic language and norms." *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e119 (pp. 59-60)

   **Abstract:** Both Mehr et al.'s credible signaling hypothesis and Savage et al.'s music and social bonding hypothesis emphasize the role of multilevel social structures in the evolution of music. Although empirical evidence preferentially supports the social bonding hypothesis, rhythmic music may enable bonding in a way uniquely fitted to the normative and language-based character of multilevel human societies.

   **Note:** This commentary addresses both Mehr et al. and Savage et al. It is listed under both target articles. If you choose this commentary with Mehr as your target article, focus on what it says about the credible signaling hypothesis.
