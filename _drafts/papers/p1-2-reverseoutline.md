## Checklist:

- Before explaining someone else's argument, you must understand it. A reverse outline can help you consolidate your notes on a source in a way that allows you to better understand the argument's claims.
- This is an optional assignment. If you submit, it will help you organize your thoughts for the draft, and I will be able to give you feedback.

Logistics for this assignment only:

- State the source's thesis at the top (2 sentences maximum).
- Do not include source quotations. Use paraphrases only. Put the page number or range for each point at the end of that point. e.g. (22-23).
- Include a correctly formatted reference list (which will include only one source, Pinker)
- Attribute your points to the correct source.	Write "Pinker says that cooperation evolved..." instead of writing "Cooperation evolved...".
- Follow the thesis with numbered/lettered lines in a hierarchical outline form. The exact number/letter scheme doesn't matter, but make sure each line has a unique indicator because I'll need to be able to easily refer to specific lines in the outline for my feedback. In this assignment, I'll call each numbered/lettered part of the outline a "point", but "point" refers to an indicator followed by sentence, not an idea in a general sense. (A point would be: "3a. Boyd claims that this experiment shows that cooperation is heritable.").
- Each numbered point is called a "main point" and lettered points indented underneath main points are "subpoints", and "point" without an adjective refers to both.
	- Avoid:
		- 1a. The appeal of Harlequin romance is universal, and is built on the historical and cross-cultural popularity of romance as a genre. (386-387)
		- 1b. Romance fiction is the most lucrative fiction category in the United States and is dominated by Harlequin Enterprises Limited, the largest publisher of romance novels internationally. (387)
		- 1c. Women make up 90% of the consumer base of romance fiction. (388)
		- _Problem: there is no main point summarizing the three subpoints. An appropriate main point might be: (1) Harlequin romances are a popular series of romance fiction that appeals primarily to women._
- Each point will paraphrase a claim from the source argument.
- Each point in the outline should contain EXACTLY one complete sentence--not two or more sentences. Do not use more than one sentence per point in any circumstance.
	- Correct:
		- 1. Dance movements convey sex-specific information indicating an individual's biological quality (352).
			- A. Male physical strength may be a mating-related quality conveyed through dance as more elaborate dance movements are challenging and require a higher level of coordination to be executed (352-353).
			- B. In contrast, female dance movements may provide information about their fertility (353).
- Each point should be a COMPLETE sentence with a clear subject and verb, ending in a period—not a phrase or sentence fragment.
	- Avoid: "Adaptive traits from the EEA" [not a sentence]
	- Avoid: "What happens in modern society." [not a sentence]
	- Avoid:
		- 1. Action films and video games teach coping by:
			- a) Balancing negative and positive experiences and creating a hierarchy among them.
			- b) Integrating negative emotions into positive goals to pose activating challenges.
		- _Problem: (1) is not a complete sentence by itself. (A) and (B) are not complete sentences by themselves. The incorrect format encourages the student to make a list of points without really summarizing them into increasingly broad ideas._
- The subject of your point sentences should NOT be the source author, but a thing the author talks about (an idea or another author). This is very important! If you don't follow this rule you will likely end up describing the source as a piece of writing rather than actually summarizing its argument.
	- Avoid:
		- 1. The authors of this study assume that musicality is universal in human vocal communication.
			- a. To overcome the cultural variation in music, the authors focus on the universality of musicality since it's a product of our brain's physiology and psychology. (2)
		- _Problem: both points describe the assumptions or actions of the authors. Possible correction: (1) Musicality is universal in human vocal communication, (a) Despite the cultural variation in music, the universality of music can be explained because music is a product of humans' evolved brains._
- Avoid using "this" or "it" as the subject of the points
	- Avoid: "This is an example of mate selection." [What is an example of mate selection? Identify it clearly.]
- Each point should be a STATEMENT—not a question.
	- Avoid: "What does survival have to do with sexual selection?" [not a statement]
- Each point should make a claim about your TOPIC, it should NOT make a claim about what the source does in the paper. Yes, I am repeating this same point with additional examples because this guideline is so important.
	- Avoid: "Boyd gives several supporting examples."
	- Correct: "One modern mechanism for punishing cheaters is a police force." (stating the example)
	- Avoid: "Pinker gives several reasons that music is pleasurable."
	- Correct: "Music includes sounds similar to those found in the EEA" (written as if you are Pinker making this argument)
- Do not include lines about the paper introduction or conclusion in the outline. The thesis stated above the outline will serve as the introduction to the outline.
