Submit a full draft of Paper 1 as an attached Word document. Re-read the Paper 1 assignment and make sure you understand the goals, structure, and expectations of the expected paper. Ask if you have any questions.

To help me provide useful feedback, highlight parts of your draft:

- highlight your thesis in yellow (2 sentences max)
- highlight the topic sentence in each paragraph in light blue (excluding the paragraph with your thesis)

Checklist:

- does your introduction clarify 1) the academic conversation, 2) what your source argues to contribute to that conversation, and (optionally) 3) your observations about that contribution (but not observations that claim that the source argument is wrong)?
- is your thesis highlighted?
- is your thesis a positive claim about the source argument (good) or is it a description of what you intend to do in the paper (avoid)?
- does every paragraph have one topic sentence, highlighted in light blue?
- is every paragraph about one main idea that is fully captured in the topic sentence? (this means your paragraph shouldn't have sentences that are outside the scope of the topic sentence)
- did you really check and follow the formatting and citation guidelines?
- did you search for all instances of "this" and "it" and "they" to make sure your referents are clear and unambiguous?
- did you check all quotes for accuracy against the original source?
- did you get feedback from a reader as to whether your argument adequately explains the source argument?
