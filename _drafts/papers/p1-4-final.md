title: Paper 1
---

Submit Paper 1 as an attached Word document. Follow all of the instructions in the Paper 1 draft assignment, including highlighting, citations, etc., but limit your paper to 1500 words max.

Do not submit your papers late! Plan to submit them at least two hours before the deadline in case you need time to sort any technological issues. In case of a very unlikely emergency problem with Canvas, before the deadline, email the paper to me as plain text (copy and paste the paper into an email, don't attach a file), send me a pic of the Canvas error, and submit the paper as a properly formatted file as soon as possible.
