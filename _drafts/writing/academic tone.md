Too critical:

> "I find the base argument to be rather trivial: Pleasing our senses will please us. While Pinker interestingly extends this argument to evolution, suggesting that pleasing our evolved senses will no doubt please us,  its explanatory power decreases upon exploration of other fictional narratives." [My take in general on his first argument]

"In addition, while Pinker does consider a counterexample of tear-jerkers, his explanation of benign masochism may be rather limited. I argue that an extension to consider how we can engage actively with art to feel pleasure will help strengthen Pinkerâ€™s argument." [My take in general on his second argument]

While I'm not actively correcting Pinker's arguments, I am afraid that I sound too critical of his arguments.
In addition, can I clarify if my essay structure of [Intro + General Argument + (Specific Argument + My Take) * 2 + Conclusion] is in line with the scope?
