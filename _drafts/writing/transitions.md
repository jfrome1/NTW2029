- The class handout ["Elements of the Essay"](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/users/90279/files/2234502?verifier=LG7nuG6G2glrVweNdt79uMWx0EuUreNNLCBkdixt&wrap=1) describes "stitching" as language that connects parts of an essay, and transitions are one type of stitching
- transitions connect two ideas/sentences/paragraphs in a way that helps the reader understand how the two things relate to each other
- transitions between sentences are best handled using the "X does Y" and "old then new" guidelines covered in class notes on sentence structure <!-- add link when page is ready -->
- paragraph transitions have several goals
	- indicate that the author is moving from idea A to idea B
	- indicate how idea A is related to idea B (i.e. their logical relationship)
	- (if appropriate) help the reader understand the relationship between ideas by re-characterizing or redescribing idea A before introducing idea B
- paragraph transitions usually occur as part of topic sentences
	- if the relationship between ideas is complicated, it might take a whole sentence just to make the transition, and then the topic sentence may follow as a separate sentence
- Read the following paragraph. After, consider the examples of better and worse transitions that would begin the first sentence of the following paragraph.

```
Pinker argues that humans enjoy art, including paintings, music, and fictional narratives, because art is reminiscent of the specific advantageous visual attractions that would have increased one's reproductive fitness in the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptiveness (EEA). For instance, to be drawn to valuable objects like fertile lands, plants, and people would have been beneficial to human survival in the EEA (527). Pinker states that seeing fake lands, plants, and people on a sheet of canvas will not increase someone's chances of survival. Humans are still drawn to such  artworks, he states, because they still stimulate the senses that attract humans to real fitness-enhancing objects.
```

- No transition: the essay just stops talking about one idea and starts talking about a different idea (sometimes related, but still a different idea).

```
Humans are still drawn to such  artworks, he states, because they still stimulate the senses that attract humans to real fitness-enhancing objects.
Some argue that people create music to attract mates.
```

- Weak transition: the essay indicates that the writer is changing topics, but doesn't give the reader any indication of how the next topic is related to the previous one.

```
Humans are still drawn to such  artworks, he states, because they still stimulate the senses that attract humans to real fitness-enhancing objects.
Pinker also states that some scholars believe people create music to attract mates.
```

- above, the topic switch is indicated by the words "also states"

- Weak transition (in some cases): the essay indicates that the writer is changing topics, but doesn't summarize or refer to the idea of the  previous paragraph  to remind the reader of that idea before stating the idea in the next paragraph.

```
Humans are still drawn to such  artworks, he states, because they still stimulate the senses that attract humans to real fitness-enhancing objects.
This argument supports Pinker's claim that art is a byproduct.
```

- Unfortunately, this example above doesn't persuasively illustrate the problem with not summarizing the idea of the previous paragraph. The transition probably doesn't seem that confusing. However, it's not confusing  because you've read the first sentence several times and because I'm giving just one sentence of the pre-transition paragraph. Usually, the pre-transition paragraph is longer and contains several concepts, so "this argument" will seem ambiguous and confusing to the reader.

- Strong transition: summarizes the paragraph ideas and uses words that imply logical relations between the ideas so the reader sees how this paragraph relates to the last one.

```
Humans are still drawn to such  artworks, he states, because they still stimulate the senses that attract humans to real fitness-enhancing objects.
Art's ability to simulate real-life objects is central to Pinker's claim that art is a byproduct.
```

- Words that indicate logical relationships between ideas
	- contrasting ideas: however, although, but
		- these connect two ideas that are opposed. "[idea A]; however, [idea B]" means "Reader, given that I have told you idea A, you might think that idea B would not be the case, but in fact, it is the case". Readers will be confused if ideas A and B are not actually related in this way.
		- proper use:
			- > Evolutionary theory suggests that universal human activities are universal because they increased reproductive fitness in the EEA. However, art is universal despite the fact that it doesn't seem to increase reproductive fitness.
		- improper use:
			- > Evolutionary theory suggests that universal human activities are universal because they increased reproductive fitness in the EEA. However, Pinker gives three reasons that music might be enjoyable.
		- improper use (actual student example):
			> Gervais & Wilson (2005) uses evolutionary psychology to explain the phenomenon of human laughing. They use the term "laughter" broadly and do not specify any scenarios. However, consumption of comedic art-forms is pervasive and entrenched in modern society.
	- dependent ideas: therefore, hence, since, because
		- these connect ideas where one idea is true because the other is true. "[idea A]; hence/therefore/because, [idea B]" means "Reader, idea B is true because idea A is true, and belief in idea B depends on belife in idea A." Readers will be confused if ideas A and B are not actually related in this way.

	- [more logical relations to come]

<!-- weak transition:
> Pinker then talks about why we are attracted to fictional stories. He highlights that the desire for fiction serves as a "cognitive adaptation," by noting its instructional value (539).

good transition:
> Pinker's case for attraction towards fictional stories is different. Instead of arguing that enjoying fiction is a byproduct, he highlights that enjoying fiction is a "cognitive adaptation," noting its instructional value (539).

- e.g. sentence to sentence transitions to revise
	- In the 'Beginner's Guide', the author cites cosmetics use as an example of behaviour that is explained by evolutionary psychology. Sexual selection is an evolutionary process that drives the survival of a species.
	-  Evolutionary psychology explains that people wear make-up in modern society to conform to societal beauty standards, which were also derived from evolution. Institutional facts are facts that "exist only because we all agree that they do" (144).
