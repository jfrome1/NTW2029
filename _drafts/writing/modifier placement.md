> Many philosophers ignore EP's heuristic aspects, Goldfinch argues, due to criticisms by the people who still deny evolution.

The phrase "due to criticisms" clearly modifies "many philosophers ignore". The criticisms of evolution is the reason Goldfinch gives to explain why philosophers ignore EP's heuristic aspects.

> Goldfinch argues that many philosophers ignore EP's heuristic aspects due to criticisms by the people who still deny evolution..

The phrase "due to criticisms" is ambiguous. It could modify "Goldfinch argues". If the reader takes it to modify "Goldfinch argues", then they will think that the criticisms mentioned explain why Goldfinch is making his argument, not why philosophers ignore EP's heuristic aspects.

> To understand Pinker's argument, Pinker first introduces the concept of 'pleasure
buttons', an analogy explaining how we can derive pleasure for ourselves independently, similar
to motion of pushing a button.
