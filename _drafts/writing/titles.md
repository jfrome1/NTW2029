Guidelines for essay titles:

- give your draft and final papers an appropriate title (short assignments don't need titles unless indicated)
- titles should be centered and separated from the first line of the essay by one line/space; other formatting is not necessary
- good titles tell the reader the paper topic and give a sense of the specific aspect of that topic that the paper will discuss
- titles do not need to have two parts connected with a colon, although that format is fine
- see _The Craft of Research_ p. 247 for additional guidance
- you can see examples of TWW paper titles in the student journal _folio_: https://foliojournal.wordpress.com/
- example good titles:
	- Are Memes Like Genes? The Validity of Comparing Cultural Inheritance to Genetic Inheritance
	- On the Evolution of Cooperation among Humans: The Prerequisites for Reciprocal Altruism
- example titles that can be improved:
	- Evolutionary Psychology, an Unsung Hero in Our Lives (too general)
	- Punishment for Prestige (topic/approach unclear)
	- A Summary of Boyd, Chapter 3 (too literal)
