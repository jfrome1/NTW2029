Empty phrases are words that add little content, meaning they don't really give the reader any useful information. Examples include phrases such as "in his writing", "we should also note that", and "is it important to mention". There are cases where such phrases are necessary, but usually it is better to remove them. Doing so makes your writing much more active and engaging.

Some categories of empty phrases are:

## Location phrases

- Students often reference where a quote or idea appears in the source using general terms. I don't think most of them realize that they are doing this. Examples:

> Dunbar provides explanations in the earlier pages of the chapter to partly explain mate choice...

> Later in the paper, Badcock states that...

The general location of an idea in the source is rarely important for the reader to know and should usually not be mentioned (ask me if you think your case might be an exception, as exceptions do exist). However, it is important to give the reader in-text citation information with specific page numbers so they can find the idea or quote in the original source, so you should continue to do that.

## Opinion warnings

Singapore writing instruction often emphasizes a clear difference between fact and opinion. This distinction is important when first learning to write so students understand that they must support claims with facts.  However, this distinction is less useful in higher level academic writing,  where people are discouraged from offering unsupported opinions and where facts are complicated and often in dispute. Academic readers understand that academic writing reflects the author's opinions and beliefs, so there is no need to state it.

Thus, try to avoid statements in your writing that essentially say, "this is only my opinion".  Phrases like "I believe," "in my opinion," "I feel," or "if you ask me" weaken your argument, particularly if they appear in your thesis statement, by suggesting that you don't have a good reason to hold that belief. Instead, take a definite stance (even if it is qualified, hedged, or limited) and back it up with evidence and argument.

## "It is X that"

Examples:

- It is clear that...
- It is important that...
- It is significant that...

Don't tell the reader that something is clear/important/significant, because even if it is true, telling them won't convince them of it. Instead, show them that it is important by discussing *why* it is important and what implications it has.

## Other filler phrases

- I will also say that... (just make the claim)
- I would like to argue that... (just make the claim, or if needed, use "I argue that")
