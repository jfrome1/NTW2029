## Writing assistance and instruction

The NUS Libraries Writers' Centre offers peer tutoring for your academic writing in any division or course as well as for creative and extra-curricular writing projects. A consultation at the Writers' Centre is a friendly, non-judgmental conversation about your writing with a tutor who is trained to help you at any stage of your process. You can go in with anything from a vague idea to a complete draft and your tutor will work with you to set goals, suggest effective writing and revision strategies, and identify the next steps you can take. Book an appointment with a peer tutor here: https://nus.mywconline.com/.
