## Summaries

In this course, you will frequently write summaries of readings to practice the skills of understanding complex texts and conveying their main points in a way that a reader who has not read the source text can understand. This skill is essential to writing academic papers, which always respond to things others have written.

The same text will sometimes be assigned to a group of students, but they are not group writing assignments. Each student should write their own individual summary of the assigned text.

Summaries should meet these requirements:

- length is below maximum word count (specified for each assignment)
- grammatically correct
- written in language that is as simple and concise as possible
- conveys the main ideas of the text
- written entirely in the student's own words, with no quotes from the text (it is ok to quote individual words or phrases that are keyterms)
- not written as if the student is the original author but mentions the author's name: "Dunbar et. al. states that..." or "Badcock makes two main points..."
- at the top of the summary, indicates the name and section of the text you are summarizing (something that makes it clear which of the assigned texts you are summarizing vs. those your classmates are summarizing)
- also, at the top of the summary, tell me if you are in class section E1 (2pm) or E2 (4pm)
- submitted by 11:59 pm on the due date

Summaries are designed to take 90 min or less to complete, including reading time. Please do not spend more than 2 hours on a summary assignment.

Summaries do not need introductions or conclusions.

I will bring hardcopies of some summaries to class to discuss as a group. We will read the summaries out loud and discuss both their content and form (at least one from each group). Students in the group who did _not_ read the source being summarized will ask the summary's author questions until they understand the source's ideas. While at first it may be uncomfortable to discuss your writing in public, the process is incredibly useful for all.

I choose which summaries to discuss in class based on various factors, such as:

- provides examples of writing topics I want to discuss
- allows useful discussion of the text's content
- student has not yet received class feedback on their summary (no guarantees, I try to give everyone a chance but balance this effort with other pedagogical goals)

Every student can receive detailed individual feedback on summaries even if they are not discussed in class. Simple make an appointment with me. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the friendly, non-judgmental tutors at the Writer's Center. Book an appointment with a peer tutor here: <https://nus.mywconline.com/>.

Summaries have two aspects that must be balanced: condensing and expanding. Overall, summaries condense sources by presented only selected ideas and details from those sources, which takes fewer words. However, there may be certain parts of the summary which must also explicate parts of the original text so it makes sense to a reader who doesn't have the background needed to understand the argument. In these limited instances, summaries actually expand on terms or ideas from the original source to make them comprehensible for their readers.
