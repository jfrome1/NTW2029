## Signal verbs

- summary: signal verbs
		- they conclude — use only for actual conclusions to studies or arguments, not just for any claims

## Examples

>  In their model, Kesner and Horáček identify the degree of verisimilitude (realism, i.e. a "truthful" representation of real life) and the degree of implicit belief in the reality of the depicted event as two separate factors in our socio-affective/cognitive and esthetic processing of figural art.
> In fact, our fascination with sad stories cannot be conceived without factoring in the control theory that accounts for the intrinsic value of fiction in giving us control over our emotional threshold.
> Saunders coins detectives to be mind-readers because of their exceptional ability to practice Theory of Mind.
> The altruistic punishers theory can assist in Saunders' first statement where she fails to elaborate what makes Theory of Mind so appealing other than exceptional ability, because Austin and Flesch states that to be a good punisher is to have excellent Theory of Mind.

Good use of signal verbs to make distinction:
> Following this line of logic, Pinker establishes that humans' adaptive ability of habitat selection makes us attuned to sounds of an environment as these sounds "signal safe, unsafe, or changing habitats" (537) that could directly impact our survival. He speculates that music incorporates these natural sounds, stating "perhaps some of the stripped-down figures and rhythms at the heart of a melody are simplified templates of evocative environmental sounds" (537).


Choose your signal verbs carefully. To say that a source "assumes" something suggests two things to the reader. First, it suggests that the source does not provide support for the claim. Second, it implies that the assumption is a belief that is buried underneath the text's explicit claims rather than being directly stated or even indirectly implied. To say a source assumes something means that their claims are based on an underlying belief that a reader can pick up on only if they pay close attention to the source's language. Here, the claim is not assumed, but is clear in the source and/or support is provided.

- pay very close attention to the signal verbs used when summarizing others
-  when summarizing others, avoid signal verbs  that you would avoid using in your thesis because they encourage you to describe your actions rather than actually make a claim.  Examples include:  explores, discusses, considers, analyzes,  draws connections between
