# Reader and audience terms

You should explain terms that your reader may not know well. The explanation may be very brief or may need to be more extensive based on how complex the idea is and how it is used in your argument. There is no rule about how detailed an explanation you must provide; it is a skill you will learn with feedback.

Nonetheless, these are terms you should assume your reader does not clearly understand:

- alpha male
- group selection
- multilevel selection


(At beginning of semester, list a number of terms and asked students if they know what they mean. The refer back to that list when explaining to them what they can assume a general reader knows and does not know.)
