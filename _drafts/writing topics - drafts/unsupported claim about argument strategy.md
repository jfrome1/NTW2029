Unsupported claim about argument or strategy

Claims about the limits or implications of arguments must be supported. If those claims are abstract, they should be illustrated. Be careful of phrases such as these:

> When considering this argument, we should be careful not to ignore X...

Is there a reason for this warning? Is there reason to think someone is going to ignore X? Also, why should we be careful not to do ignore X? What would that look like, and what would the problem be if we ignored X?

> The problem is that the argument only talks about X and doesn't consider another factor, Y.

Why is it a problem to not consider factor Y? Would considering Y show that the claims about X are wrong? How would our ideas about the argument change if we considered Y? Illustrate with a concrete example.

> Secondly, it would be interesting to  apply Dunbar's argument into the context of dating apps which are mainly imaged-based, since it is relevant to today's society where many look to dating apps for relationships and speculate people's behavior in dating apps, in comparison to dating classified ads used in the past that are more text-based.

Why would it be interesting to do apply his argument in this way? What do you think it would show? What current phenomenon might it explain?
