- intro to arguments using Toulmin categories
- Key components of an argument	
	- Claim: your point, what you want your reader to believe; your thesis is the main claim of your paper	
	- Reason (analysis): an assertion that supports your claim and leads your reader to accept it, often joined to a claim with "because"	
	- Evidence: facts presented to support a reason; what counts as good evidence varies by discipline	
	- Warrant: a general principle that explains why your particular reason supports your particular claim; the general, underlying principle that logically justifies, or warrants, relating your particular reason to your particular claim  	
- Implicit reasoning and evidence

- exercise: identify the claim, reason, evidence, and warrant	
	- "I just ate a brownie. I have to go to the gym now."
- what do I with warrants?	
	- when you are writing your paper, map out the logic of your argument	
	- when reading a source, map out the logic of their arguments, and question other writers' arguments by challenging their warrants	
	- test the logic of the arguments	
		- is the warrant reasonable?	
		- does it really show how the reason supports the claim?	
		- is it sufficiently limited? i.e., does it make broad or absolute claims that cannot be true due to counterexamples?	
		- is it superior to any competing warrants? would some version of a competing claim also seem reasonable?	
	- note: Once you have identified the role of warrants, you will be prepared to make and anticipate a much broader range of challenges to arguments.	Readers are not likely to be limited to doubting only the truth of individual claims and reasons; they may very well be skeptical of the warrants.	This is the skepticism that writers most often fail to anticipate, and fail to deal with.
