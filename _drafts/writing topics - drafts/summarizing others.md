- recommended reading:
	- _TSIS_ chp. 2
	- _COR_ p 98-9, how to decide whether to quote, paraphrase, or summarize, p. 99-101, how to retain context for source content
- ways to incorporate ideas from others into your writing: paraphrase, summary, quotation, explication/explanation
- terms defined
	- paraphrase: restate the ideas from a text at roughly the same level of detail as the original but using different language
	- summary: restate the only the essential points of a text in a shorter form and often in a different order than the original
	- quotation: restate part of a text using the exact same wording, marked with quotation marks and citation
	- explication: restate the ideas from a text in a longer form, making implicit ideas and definitions explicit, so a generalist reader can more easily understand the ideas in the source
		- the source might be hard to undersatnd because it presumes significant background knowledge
		- the source might use words that are ambiguous, confusing, or misleading
		- an explication should fill in the background knowledge or use different wording so it is easier to understand than the original
- academic writing can use all four methods, and analysis of a source usually uses all four
- why summarize what others wrote?
	- provide context for your ideas as part of an ongoing conversation
	- provide evidence for your claims
	- show objections that others may have to your claims
- types of summary
	- comprehensive summary: used for personal notes, it allows you to quickly review the content of the source without re-reading the entire source
	- selective summary: used in academic writing, it includes only the parts of the source needed for the purposes of the paper, such as:
		- supporting your argument
		- orienting your reader to an academic conversation
		- helping your reader understand the context and contribution of your argument
- summary: quantity
	- summaries must balance 1) accurately reflecting the source content and 2) emphasizing the content relevant to your thesis
	- avoid "list summaries" that include everything from the source
	- reasons writers might not include enough summary
		- fear of devoting too much attention to other people's ideas
		- lack of attention to the reader's ignorance of your sources and their arguments
	- reasons writers might include too much summary
		- insecurity or fear of expressing your own thoughts and opinions
		- they might not have sufficiently narrowed down their topic so they are including too much information from sources
		- they are used to summarizing for study purposes (comprehensive summary) and are summarizing an entire source rather than just the parts relevant to their thesis
- summary: accuracy
	- you want to summarize sources charitably, even helping them word their arguments more persuasively ("steelmanning" their position), so that your response addresses more significant topics (why someone intelligent might support that argument) rather than less significant topics (such as misunderstandings based on poor word choice)
	- avoid biased summaries that undercut your credibility and the strength of your argument
	- play "believing game" to provide neutral/fair summary that doesn't misrepresent the source's position as a cliché
	- summarizing someone else in a way that makes their position seem weak (sometimes called a "strawman") hurts your credibility and does not actually add to the conversation (since it is not responding to what they actually think)
	- pay very close attention to the signal verbs used when summarizing others
- summary: framing
	- use summary as a way of introducing your own response to another person's view
	- try to avoid repetitive or bland formulas like "she says" or "they believe" in favor of more specific / accurate formulas  (also discussed in the notes on framing quotes)
	- templates in _TSIS_ pp. 293-296 (discussed on pp. 30-42)
- summary: introducing
	- Singapore students often introduce summaries using the structure, "In [name of work/article/book], [Author] says..." Avoid this wording. That structure is most appropriate when you are going to discuss a literary work, where the focus is on the particular work, rather than discussing an academic work, where the focus is on who made the argument rather than where the argument appeared.
	- Instead, say "[Author] (year) says...", perhaps introducing the idea with a contextualizing topic such as "When discussing tragedy, Freeland (1999) argues that..."
	- examples for revision
		> The act of laughing is so prevalent and intertwined in our everyday lives. It is often a subconscious reaction, we do not track how frequently we do it. Little do most people realize that human beings have different kinds of laughter, each with various proposed theories about its origin from evolutionary psychology. In the 2005 Paper, "The Evolution and Functions of Laughter and Humor: A Synthetic Approach", Matthew Gervais and David Wilson (G&W) brought together multiple perspectives, notably evolutionary psychology, to possibly explain and understand the human laughing phenomena.
- summary: attributing claims to source
	- you must clearly attribute claims to a source when paraphrasing, summarizing, or quoting ideas
	- how to do 2nd level attribution (when one source attributes an idea to another source): use signal verbs to make clear
		- e.g.
			> Dunbar et. al. (2005) introduces Sober and Wilson's multi-level selection theory as a possible explanation for non-kin altruism.
	- e.g.s that need revision—what must be fixed? why?
		> Grodal proposes two adaptive mechanisms that account for why we consume sad stories: our fascination with sad stories and desire for support bonding. Sad stories appeal to us because they help us avoid negative situations. Therefore, our fascination with sad stories is an adaptive trait. Grodal argues that our fascination with sad stories helps enhance our reproductive fitness because it allows us to "seek-out, process, and cope with negative information even if it is unpleasant" (Grodal, 2009, p. 142), thereby enhancing our learning. He makes an important note: due to evolution, our minds are adapted to identify any critical information that can help us "avoid negative events in real life " (Grodal, 2009, p. 141).  Avoiding negative situations in life such as being caught by a predator or being in the face of death necessarily helps increase our reproductive fitness. As such, our fascination with sad stories helps teach us how to avoid them in the first place through fictional simulation. Our fascination thus provides a form of 'training' that mentally and emotionally prepares our response to such negative situations in real life; the outcome of this training is termed enhanced learning.
		> When readers enjoy detective fiction, a large reason is because they enjoy the character of the detective. Zunshine explores the reasons as to why detective fiction is appealing using evolutionary psychology, and one of her arguments includes that the detective character is appealing because of Theory of Mind. Specifically, that we find detectives appealing because they inspire us to practice our own Theory of Mind skills.
		> To add to the academic conversation, Varella et al. discuss the evolution of artistcality through female intrasexual competition. They reviewed empirical evidence on the sex differences in artisticality and determined that women have a greater proclivity towards the arts than men.
		> Zunshine also argues that detective fiction is addictive due to its ability to engage the readers' minds. Engaging the reader's intellectual ability also allows readers to exercise their ToM. ToM is the ability of humans to explain others' behavior based on their thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and desires (Ruhl, 2020). Zunshine states that, unlike normal fiction where the readers are made to believe the protagonist from the beginning before realizing the truth, detective fiction engages our ToM by forcing us to disbelieve everything from the start (2006).

"However, Clasen’s argument that horror fiction can “prepare us for confronting them (dangers) in real life” (p. 50) is incorrect.  Clasen’s argument is that because horror fiction exploits adaptive traits which are fitness-enhancing, horror fiction is therefore pleasurable since the process of gaining valuable skills in terms of preparedness and vigilance is rewarding. Clasen’s theory can be corrected because the threats depicted in horror fiction now are unlike threats modern humans can experience which is in contrast with horror stories in the EEA which are told primarily to inform and protect the population. Thus it would be wrong to argue that horror fiction is appealing because horror fiction is adaptive. Clasen himself admits that “the situations represented are unlikely, implausible, or straight-out impossible” (p. 50) in reference to the dangerous agents and situations commonly depicted in today’s horror fiction. In the EEA, horror stories were mainly told verbally and passed down from generation to generation, also known as folktales. Such folktales were centred around very real threats in the EEA, ranging from predators, like tigers, to unfamiliar territory, and even to natural disasters, which at the time would have been thought of as otherworldly and scary due to science not being discovered yet."

Actual source:

"Horror stories let us feel genuine fear, anxiety, terror, and so on, but at low risk and little cost. They give us emotionally saturated experience with the very fringes of human experience, and they let us discover and challenge our own limits. Such stories can also traumatize us and hurt us profoundly, of course, but, at their best, they function to widen our emotional and cognitive repertoire. Horror stories sensitize us to danger and to the darker aspects of existence, they help us reflect on these aspects, and they may even prepare us for confronting them in real life. Curiously, though, many of the monstrous agents and fictional scenarios depicted in horror fiction are far-removed from the agents and scenarios encountered in real life. The emotions elicited by horror are genuine, but the situations represented are unlikely, implausible, or straight-out impossible. The genre brims with supernatural content, which commands its own peculiar attraction." (50)

Student wrote:

"Why do modern humans enjoy horror fiction despite the negative emotions elicited? I postulate that horror fiction is pleasurable for modern humans because the enjoyment is a by-product of our adaptive traits. My argument contrasts with Clasen’s argument that the enjoyment of horror fiction is because horror fiction directly activates our adaptive traits, making horror fiction fitness-enhancing."

"The appeal of artworks that stimulate negative emotion lies partly in their ability to satisfy morbid curiosity, our evolved curiosity about dangerous situations and agents. But more broadly, such artworks appeal to an evolved desire for vicarious experience, a desire to expand our experiential horizons through imaginative activity." 50
