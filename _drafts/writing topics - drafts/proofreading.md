- Carefully proofread your paper for clarity and grammar.
- Follow the advice in my colleague's [style guide.](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/27152/files/298400?wrap=1) Pay particular attention to point 5, "Unclear referents." I recommend doing a word search in your paper for terms such as "this" and "it" to make sure you are not using them in ambiguous ways, especially when they are the subjects of a sentence.
