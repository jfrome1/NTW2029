# Paper length

If you think that talking about one narrow argument won't offer enough content to write a whole paper, ask yourself these questions:

- did you set up the general academic conversation?
- did you explain how your source fits into that conversation, who/what they are responding to, and what their response is?
- for each of the claims you are making (either your own or summaries of source claims), do you explain terms and concepts that your reader might not understand?
- do you use transitions/stitching to clearly connect your sentences and paragraphs, showing how one logically relates to the next, rather than just changing topics from one to the next?
- do you support your claims about the source argument with quotes, where needed?
- do you introduce your quotes and follow quoted material with an explanation of what you take the quote to mean and how it is relevant to your thesis?
- do you illustrate your abstract claims with specific, concrete examples to help the reader understand your argument?
