- reasons alone cannot settle empirical disputes
- evidence is the best way to determine the truth of empirical claims (i.e., factual claims about the way the world is)
- reasoning and evidence together are needed to determine the truth of normative or prescriptive claims (i.e., claims about the way the world should be, such as "rich countries should help poor countries")


# relationship between claims, reasons, and evidence



- student questions
	- what types of evidence are "good" or "bad"?
	- is critical thinking just about determining what is true? what about texts that do not have solid truths (e.g. religious texts)?
	- how can we know if someone is making claims that are objective (facts) vs. subjective (e.g. morality)?
	- are there certain [true] things that cannot be proved by evidence?
	- why is it not enough to just believe, why do we need evidence?
