- CoR 3 & 4 - from topics to questions to problems
	- CoR makes a distinction between research questions and research problems, but I use these fairly interchangeably
	- From topics to questions: you have your broad topic (EP and art), and you will find a focused question within that
	- CoR 3.4 The Most Significant Question: So What?
  		- why would others think this is a question worth asking?
  		- would would be lost or what wouldn't we understand if this is not answered?
  		- for yourself, it's ok to just want to know, but for readers, you must answer this question
  		- 3.4.1 Step 1: Name Your Topic
	  		- 1. I am trying to learn about / working on / studying...
  		- 3.4.2 Step 2: Add an Indirect Question
	  		- 2. because I want to find out who / what / when / where / whether / why / how...
  		- 3.4.3 Step 3: Answer So What? by Motivating Your Question
	  		- 3. in order to help my reader understand how, why, or whether...
	- to move from question to problem requires being able to state the significance of your question from your readers' point of view rather than being a question whose answer interests you alone
	- "problem" in the ordinary sense mean something to avoid, but in the academic sense problems are more like puzzles or riddles— something we look for in order to solve
	- practical vs conceptual problems: what should we do (practical) vs what should we think (conceptual)
	- Paper 2 is about a conceptual problems
	- problem structure
  		- general problem structure: a situation and undesirable consequences of that situation
  		-  for conceptual problems, the undesirable situation is always some version of not knowing or understanding something
  		- the undesirable consequence of not answering a conceptual question is always that it prevents us from answering another even more significant question
  		- if the second question is not significant to your readers, they won't care about answering the first question

- ask class: how many of you read COR, pp. 38-39, 44 before writing your answers to assignment 5?
- you narrow down your potential paper topic from a general topic, to narrower questions, to sources that can answer those questions, but what you find in the sources will cause you to revise your questions
- types of questions people ask about evolution and art
	- is the ubiquity of art due to evolved traits, and if so, which ones?
	- which function(s) of art were adaptive in the EEA and thus drove the evolution of art-related behaviors?
	- of current art behaviors, which are due to evolution of traits specific to art, and which are due to traits that are more general but are applied to art in the modern context?
	- how can EP help us understand the features of art from the perspective of the artist/creator? (e.g. why art is made with certain content or features)
	- how can EP help us understand the features of art from the perspective of the audience/consumer? (e.g. how do certain types of art generate certain emotions)


- "Is the research topic supposed to be a binary one, in the sense that you can only get a yes/no answer from?"
	- The topic is not supposed to be a question, but an area of knowledge. It should be a noun.
- "Is it alright if my significance is one of practical significance instead of conceptual significance?"
	- It is fine to have a secondary significance that is practical, but the primary significance of your answer to the question should be conceptual, since that is the type of question you can answer in the type of paper we are writing.

- discussion of submitted research questions
	- use categories to narrow questions about EP and art
  		- certain theories of EP (byproduct, survival selection, sexual selection, and subsets of these)
  		- certain art forms
  		- genres/styles
  		- creation vs reception vs the object itself
	- Good starting place
  		- Children's storybooks often have a recurring theme of good over evil over many years set in a fictional setting. How might EP explain and predict the kinds of storylines we create for children, with the theory that art could provide risk-free practice for later life when similar circumstances might arise? (Tooby and Cosmides, 2001) 
  		- Does EP predict that consumers of art tend to enjoy works of art that promote the same values as the values that said consumers might have? (To be more specific, I'm curious to find out why some people sympathize with villainous characters in fiction or play as villains in games. Is it because these characters possess some values that people can relate to?)
  		- How would EP explain how the process of creating art, or art therapy, improves mental well-being?
  		- Why is engaging in/spectating martial arts so popular, if we have an evolutionary predisposition to feel repulsed at the sight of blood and violence, as well as an innate fear of physical harm?
	- Way too broad, generally
  		- If art is a reflection of basic human motivations, how might EP explain the kind of music that was created and evolved over time?
  		- Which theory/theories of art and evolution can be used to explain how and why theatre might have evolved?
	- Too broad, need to specify the concept in the question
  		- If gloomy, dreary paintings evoke such negative emotions in us/do not conform to theories that advocate for evolved aesthetic preferences, why do they still hold such high value today?
  		- How can EP explain our tendency to get attached to non-human/ cartoon characters in media?
  		- How can EP be used to explain the pop culture revolution of memes (I consider it an art form) in the 21st century?
  		- Is artistic inspiration explainable by EP? If so, is it counted as an adaptive trait?
	- Assumes facts that would need to be already established in the literature, but I'm not sure that they have been
  		- How can we relate EP to the romanticisation of mental illness in relation to art?
  		- If making art is supposedly ubiquitous, is there an evolutionary explanation behind why society places a higher value on the opinions of art experts than laymen?
  		- Can EP explain why so many people are overly emotionally attached to characters in films, such as waifu in anime?
	  		- [JF—also, what does "overly" attached mean?]
	- Who is "we"?
  		- Why have we evolved to find certain simplistic, cute visual art more appealing than certain complicated and evidently high-effort visual art?
  		- Can evolutionary psychology provide an explanation as to why we fail to appreciate the buildings and structures we pass by as much as we appreciate artifacts in a museum, although we consider them both to be art?
	- Conceptual, but answer to the general question is already known, need a more specific question that is also appropriate to add to the conversation
  		- Certain art forms like playing a musical instrument, caricature drawing and writing fictional stories require a certain level of skill that have proven to be adaptive for one reason or another. In these cases, can such art-making behaviour be practised and/or taught?
  		- Why does it then seem that women are more 'vain' and tend to pay more attention to what clothes, jewellery and other stylistic elements they wear than men do? 
  		- Would EP predict that men and women use different methods to attract their potential partner in the EEA as compared to today's modern society?
	- Requires data that is likely ungatherable
  		- Theories about storytelling suggest that people tend to root for the protagonists of stories – how has this response to stories (literature or film) changed over time and why?
  		- There is a theory in EP that art is used as a means of mate selection and the production of art would be a signal of the reproductive fitness of the individual. Would this suggest that artists/creators are more likely to find a mate than non-artists/creators?
