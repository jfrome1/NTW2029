	- warrants  
	- from Mon notes: a general principle that connects your particular reason to your particular claim  
	- better: a general principle that explains why your particular reason supports your particular claim  
	- another teacher:  the general, underlying principle that logically justifies, or warrants, relating your particular reason to your particular claim  
	- exercise: identify the claim, reason, evidence, and warrant  
		- I just ate a brownie. I have to go to the gym now.
		- I don't want to go to dinner with Jack. He only talks about himself.
	- what do I with warrants?  
	- when you are writing your paper, map out the logic of your argument  
	- when reading a source, map out the logic of their arguments, and question other writers' arguments by challenging their warrants  
	- test the logic of the arguments  
		- is the warrant reasonable?  
		- does it really show how the reason supports the claim?  
		- is it sufficiently limited? i.e., does it make broad or absolute claims that cannot be true due to counterexamples?  
		- is it superior to any competing warrants? would some version of a competing claim also seem reasonable?  
	- note: Once you have identified the role of warrants, you will be prepared to make and anticipate a much broader range of challenges to arguments.  Readers are not likely to be limited to doubting only the truth of individual claims and reasons; they may very well be skeptical of the warrants.  This is the skepticism that writers most often fail to anticipate, and fail to deal with.
