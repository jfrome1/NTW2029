# Sources citing other sources

- Sometimes, you want to include ideas or information in your source, X, that originally appeared in another source, Y, that your source X cites and summarizes or paraphrases.
-  You have two options in a scenario like this:
	 1. Locate and read source Y, then include the  ideas or information based on your understanding of the material and properly cite source Y.
	 2. Include the ideas or information based on the way source X presents them, citing source X but not source Y.
-  only cite source Y in your paper if you include material from that source based on your own original understanding of the paper
-  If you rely on your source X rather than source Y, then use a source X because you cannot be confident that the source has properly understood or reported the material from source Y.  You must let your reader know that you're relying on source X rather than on the original presentation in source Y. Doing this is not a weakness or problem in the paper, but the reader must know which of the two options you have taken.
