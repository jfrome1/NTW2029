> The bonding comes across as affectionate and warm for the other party as she appreciates the effort and consideration he has taken in his humour. Hence, humorous men are more attractive and through their jokes, come across as warmer and more affectionate and are selected for.

> In analyzing Learmonth's misinterpretation of Dissanayake's earlier theory, I will first summarize Dissanayake's theory and illustrate how art making reduces anxiety.
> Pinker suggests that art may have provided a short-cut to experiencing pleasure and ingenuine increase in fitness because humans measured increments of fitness with pleasure. Pinker proposes that development of arts was promoted by another function of the human brain, the ability to establish ‘cause and effect’ (524) relationships between variables. From my understanding, Pinker may have implied that humans’ ability to identify pleasure-stimulating signals enabled for combining of these signals to purposefully design art to invoke more intense pleasure, giving the false impression of improved fitness. Being artificially created for the purpose of pleasure, Pinker posits that arts provides humans with more intense pleasure than available in the natural world.
