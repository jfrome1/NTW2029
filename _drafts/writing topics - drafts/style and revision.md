# Style and Revision

- sentence-level style
	- write with simple sentences, using subjects and characters, in an "X does Y" form
  		- 2a. Locke frequently repeated himself because he did not trust the power of words to name things accurately.
  		- 2b. The reason for Locke's frequent repetition lies in his distrust of the accuracy of the naming power of words.
- write sentences in subjects and characters — X does Y
	- The subject should be a "character" (concept, person, thing) like "gene" or "mate" or "artwork"
	- "characters" should be referred to with consistent keyterms
	- avoid subjects that are noun forms of actions/verbs, like "gene mutation" or "attraction of mates based on honest cues" or "works that appeal to viewers due to their biologically-relevant content"
		- e.g. avoid: "West's first hypothesis of the purpose of the mane was derived from the behaviour of male-male competition in sexual selection in which the mane is used as a shield when male lions fight with one another."
		- instead, "West hypothesizes that manes shielded male lions from attacks when they fought other lions for access to mates."
- keep same main "characters" throughout each paragraph
	- evaluate this introduction
	> The vampire bat is the only blood-sucking mammal in the world. It must feed on the blood of other animals at least once every three days, or they will die. Luckily for the bat, they can count on blood-sharing – where another bat in the same group will regurgitate blood to share with the other bat who needs it. While blood-sharing seems like a heartwarming gesture, from the point of view of evolution, blood-sharing makes little sense. Darwin first introduced his theory of natural selection in 1859, which suggests that evolution occurs due to the passing down of beneficial traits from generation to generation . The traits that increase reproductive fitness (the ability to pass on genes to the offspring) of the individual will continue being passed down, while other disadvantageous traits will eventually die out.
	- [good introduction, with a strange shift in the middle—the character introduced is evolution, then it suddenly shifts to Darwin]
- avoid excessive abstraction
	- you can use a few abstract concepts as main characters across the paper, but don't use too many and don't surround them with additional abstractions
	- illustrate abstract claims with concrete examples, but also distinguish between illustrations and supporting evidence
- passive voice vs. active voice

	+ examples to revise:
		* "Dou et al. (2021) stated that through psychological experiments, it is proved that improvisational dance is an important way to release and develop creativity."
- sentence syntax: old before new
	- start sentences with ideas/info/terms that were introduced in previous sentences,  end them with new info
	- e.g. avoid, "Natural selection explains why species have the traits that they do. Adaptations help organism survive and reproduce, and they are the traits that best match the environment."
	- e.g. better, "Natural selection explains why species have the traits that they do. Some traits better match the organism to its environment, helping it survive and reproduce, and we call those traits adaptations."
	- this rule trumps active/passive: here is one reason to use passive voice rather than active
- revise to old then new
	> Shafer and Raney (2012) propose the schema theory. Shafer and Raney suggest that antihero narratives follow a consistent plotline. The schema theory suggests that exposure to antihero narratives allows audiences to predict character traits and plotlines, leading to less moral scrutiny of the antiheroes' actions and more enjoyment via moral disengagement. Moral disengagement occurs when audiences disconnect from their usual ethical standards to justify immoral actions.
	> Termed by Richard Dawkins, "memes" refers to units of culture; this chapter also discusses "Mendelian genes" in particular, which are phenomenological units of biological inheritance.


examples to revise:

> Shafer and Raney (2012) suggest that antihero narratives follow consistent plotlines that act as schemas, allowing audiences to predict these stories' narrative events. Since audiences can predict these events, the authors argue, they are more likely to morally disconnect from their usual ethical standards. This disconnection allows audiences to justify the immoral actions of antiheroes.

> Margrethe Bruun Vaage (2017) has proposed a hypothesis that may account for viewers' sympathy toward antiheroes in her book The Antihero in American Television. Focusing on the cases of TV shows, she argues that the dual-process model of morality can account for this seemingly strange sympathy. According to this model, it is intuitive to become more willing to sympathize with people they consider their kin; in other words, people whom they are partial to. Humans even go as far as overlooking some of their moral flaws, and this powerful sympathetic tendency exists because humans' moral intuitions evolved to secure cooperation in a tribal condition.

> Additionally, within Clasen's argument, there is a generalization across all post-apocalyptic narratives without distinguishing between realistic and plausible worst-case scenarios, such as life after war, and more unrealistic and implausible ones, like a zombie apocalypse or an alien invasion.

Additionally, Clasen fails to distinguish between plausible worst-case scenarios, such as life after war, and implausible ones, like a zombie apocalypse or an alien invasion.
