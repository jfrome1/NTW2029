Concision and Wordiness

Make your writing as concise as possible. This maxim does not mean to eliminate nuance or descriptive language. You can often revise sentences to half their length without losing any meaning. A useful, step-by-step method is described here:

> He mentions that the enjoyment of art is not adaptive (524). What he means by this is that the enjoyment of art did not help humans to survive against the selection pressures we faced.

—

> Pinker explains the aforementioned phenomenon by arguing that the enjoyment of art is an evolutionary byproduct of our adaptation to enjoy being in fitness-enhancing environments.

—

> Pinker explains that the human mind has learnt what stimuli are pleasurable and has devised methods to distil pleasurable stimuli into more concentrated forms (524).

better: Humans thus enjoy supernormal stimuli more than natural pleasurable stimuli.

> Savage et al. propose three reasons as to why music might facilitate social bonding. The first reason is that when humans behave cooperatively through music-making, they engage in prosocial behaviours which are rewarding to humans and facilitate social bonding (3, 11). Prosocial behaviours refer to behaviours that benefit society as a whole, such as cooperation. Savage et al. claim that there is evidence to suggest that oxytocin levels are elevated in individuals after taking part in music activities. Oxytocin promotes individuals to adopt values and dispositions, such as generosity and trust, that facilitate bonding between individuals (11, 12). Oxytocin is a hormone that is released in the brain, that promotes positive feelings in humans, and plays roles in social bonding. Dunbar et al. (2012) add by suggesting that pleasure derived from music is due to stimulation of parts of the brain that release endorphins and dopamine, which are associated with rewards in humans (689). Within these parts of the brain lie the dopaminergic system, that is active when stimuli such as food are present. Stimuli such as food are associated with the presence of rewards and fitness enhancing environments that humans find to be pleasurable. Similarly, the dopaminergic system is also active during the perception of music, indicating that there is a fitness-enhancing environment present. Therefore, music is perceived to be pleasurable to humans.

> Mankind’s pursuit of art may be perceived  to go against the evolutionary principles that humans only engage in fitness-enhancing activities . Artistic pursuits such as cooking, painting, dancing or making music  often require time and energy which could otherwise have been used in improving survival and reproductivity . From an evolutionary biology standpoint, it is hence expected that  humans would prioritise increasing their fitness and discontinue practising art. Yet, we still continue to appreciate and consume art, contradicting expected outcomes of evolution . If art is meaningless and impractical in achieving biological success, how then have our minds evolved to gain pleasure from pursuing artistic hobbies ? In How The Mind Works, Pinker proposes that art is a man-made pleasure technology designed to take advantage of brain functions shaped by evolution . By incorporating specific elements of ancestral fitness-promoting environments, Pinker suggests that art, with the example of  music, can trigger pleasure pathways associated with increased fitness. This  has led to humans pursuing art.

Original Text:

"Evolutionary psychology suggests that the reasons why people create and appreciate art are deeply rooted in our ancestral past. According to this perspective, art may have served as a way for early humans to communicate complex ideas and emotions that would otherwise be difficult to express. By using art as a form of expression, people could build social bonds and foster a sense of community. Additionally, creating art might have allowed individuals to demonstrate their skills, which could have been attractive to potential mates. Therefore, the idea is that art plays an important role in human evolution by fulfilling several social and psychological needs."

Revised Version:

"Evolutionary psychology proposes that art creation and appreciation stem from ancestral needs. Art may have helped early humans communicate complex ideas, build social bonds, and strengthen community. Additionally, creating art allowed individuals to display skills attractive to potential mates. Thus, art likely served key social and psychological functions in human evolution."
