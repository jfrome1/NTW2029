# Illustrate abstract claim

Readers often cannot understand abstract claims without specific, concrete examples that illustrate such claims. Help the reader understand ideas more easily with specific examples.

> Basically, he is saying that people offer help expecting the recipient of help to repay the favour in future. Yet, the initial act of being altruistic incurs a cost on the helper, so it becomes unfair when the receiver of help chooses not to return the favour. Boyd calls this 'defection'.

Advanced examples:

> Pinker asserts that rhythm, which forms the crux of music, exists in our daily, repetitive actions such as “walking, running, chopping, scraping and digging” (538), all of which have an optimal rhythm at which they should be executed. He cites the example that a constant rhythmic pattern is the best rhythm at which to push a child on a swing. Pinker believes that an organism experiences “moderate pleasure” (538) when it can stick to the optimal rhythm, implying that being able to move at the optimal rhythm is fitness-enhancing. Extending his argument, when people dance, snap or shake along with the music, the mind registers the adherence of movements to the rhythm of the music, which is assumed to resemble the ideal rhythms of multiple motions, releasing large, concentrated doses of pleasurable sensations.

- problem: child's swing isn't a good example of optimal rhythm, even if Pinker uses it, because there is less clarity for this than examples like running or digging, where speed is a clear criterion (perhaps "minimal effort to maintain height" is the criterion for the child's swing)
- problem: author doesn't explicitly explain that Pinker thinks dance is a byproduct because it provides a similar sense of matching optimal rhythm (or because it provides an accessible way to achieve optimal rhythm in matching the music, even if in this case, this match isn't fitness-enhancing)
