# Misplaced modifiers

## importance of modifier location

Make sure your modifiers are placed carefully, immediately before or after the noun they modify, so that the sentence conveys the meaning you intend. Consider how changing the location of the modifier "only" changes these sentences:

"Only lions that hunted at night were successful." = The lions that hunted at night were successful, but other species that hunted at night were not.
"The lions that only hunted at night were successful" = The lions that hunted at night and didn't do other things at night were successful, but the lions that hunted and also did other things at night (such as eating or fighting) were not.
"The lions that hunted only at night were successful" = The lions that hunted at night but not at other times were successful, but lions that hunted at night and at other times not.
"The lions that hunted at night were only successful" = The lions that hunted at night were successful all of the time, and never were unsuccessful.

> If humans could only learn how to handle such situations through direct encounters with the real threats, then most humans would probably die in these encounters, and it would be difficult to prepare for threats.

> He explains that humans have adapted to improve our knowledge of threats through narratives, as it allows one to learn about a greater number of threats from others in a safe setting rather than only being able to learn through dangerous personal experiences.

# avoid dangling modifiers

A "dangling modifier" error occurs when a sentence has a modifying phrase, but it is unclear what the phrase is modifying or the phrase modifies a noun in a way that doesn't make sense. Usually, this error occurs when the sentence begins with a descriptive clause and is immediately followed by the subject of the sentence, but that subject is not what is described by the introductory clause. This error can lead to confusion or ambiguity in the sentence, as the reader may not be sure what the modifier is intended to modify.

Example: "By analyzing genetic data, our understanding of evolution improved."
Error: The modifier "by analyzing genetic data" seems to modify "our understanding of evolution," but our understanding is not something that can analyze data.
Revision: "By analyzing genetic data, scientists were able to better understand evolution."

Example: "Having evolved over millions of years, the dinosaurs' extinction remains a mystery."
Error: The modifier "having evolved over millions of years" seems to modify "the dinosaurs' extinction," but extinction is not something that evolves (even if the extinction takes millions of years to complete).
Revision: "The extinction of dinosaurs, whose evolution took place over millions of years, remains a mystery."

Dangling modifiers often occur in sentences that start with a modifier phrase that written in passive voice, because the passive voice means that the agent or noun executing the action the sentence refers to may not be named.

Example: "After studying the fossil record, the theory of evolution was supported by the evidence."
Error: The modifier "after studying the fossil record" is not clearly connected to a specific noun, leading to confusion about who or what studied the fossil record. The modifier appears to describe "the theory of evolution", which obviously cannot study the fossil record.
Revision: "After studying the fossil record, scientists found that the theory of evolution was supported by the evidence."

Example: "By studying the behavior of different species, the evolution of social behavior was better understood."
Error: The modifier "by studying the behavior of different species" is not clearly connected to a specific noun, leading to confusion about who or what studied the behavior of different species.
Revision: "By studying the behavior of different species, ethologists were able to better understand the evolution of social behavior."

Real student examples:

- > When auditory scene analysis is applied to music, Pinker asserts that music provides pleasure because our minds are able to distinguish and assign sounds in music to their soundmaker (536).
- > Aside from actually increasing biological fitness, Pinker proposes that human senses are capable of inducing pleasure when senses detect pleasure-stimulating patterns given off by fitness-promoting environments.
- > Being artificially created for the purpose of pleasure, Pinker posits that arts provides humans with more intense pleasure than available in the natural world.
