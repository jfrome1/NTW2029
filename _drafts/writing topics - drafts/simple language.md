> A group of hunter-gatherers may collectively agree to gather as much food as possible and subsequently meet to share the food they gained. With some people having a greater harvest, the altruistic behaviour of sharing surpluses reduces the risk of other individuals not being able to find sufficient food for that day and starve.

revised: Hunter-gatherers may collectively agree to share food so that those who come up short when gathering still have something to eat.

> In How the Mind Works, Steven Pinker proposes fictional stories as simulations of reality that closely resemble the features of the real world. As evidence, Pinker notes that humans prefer fictional settings that obey a logical flow, for such coherence allows fiction to feel real. He argues that such resemblance allows fiction to serve as a "simulation" for humans to experience and indirectly prepare for the endless possibilities of life, which ultimately explains why humans find fictional stories enjoyable (543).

revised: In How the Mind Works, Steven Pinker argues that fictional stories can act as simulations of reality. People prefer coherent stories with logical flow, he states, because these stories seem more "real" and thus indirectly allow people to better prepare for the endless possibilities of life (543).
