# Titles, Introductions, and conclusions

## Titles
	- The purpose of a title is to help your reader understand your paper's content; make sure that your title actually reflects the content, especially if you use wordplay
	- Ideally, titles catch readers' attention, but don't try too hard to be catchy and avoid clickbait (e.g., "The Biggest Mistake in Evolutionary Psychology")
	- Some title options:
		- Simple title that reflects your thesis: Understanding the Swiss Army Knife Model of the Mind
		- Question or problem to the left, thesis to the right: What is the Swiss Army Knife Model for? Different Functions for Analogies of the Mind
		- Catchy phrase to the left, topic on the right: The Toolbox in Our Skull: Mental Modularity and the Swiss Army Knife Model of the Mind
		- Topic on the left, approach on the right: The Swiss Army Knife Model of the Mind: A Functional Analysis

## Introductions

- Read COR chp. 16

1.	Contextualizing the background: it establishes a shared understanding between reader and writer about the larger issue that the writer will address
2.	Statement of the problem: a condition of incomplete knowledge or understanding, as well as the cost/consequences of that condition
3.	Solution to the problem: your thesis

 [intro length]

An essay's guiding question is most often found at the beginning of the introduction. The question is typically presented in two parts. In the first part you establish some stable context or status quo by making an assertion that is or seems true. You then challenge that seemingly stable notion by presenting a destabilizing condition that complicates or calls it into question

- Key elements of a good introduction
	- Accepted view: what we think we know (stable context or status quo)
	- Problem: a problem with what we think we know
	- Thesis: a proposed argument that will address this problem
	- Significance: the benefit of accepting this solution
- Accepted view (i.e., stable context or status quo)
	- Guides the reader to the broad topic and provides background necessary to understand the essay problem and thesis
	- Can be something generally believed, something argued or implied by a specific person, or something that seems to be going on within a text or data set
	- Does not have to be a view about the topic itself; can also be a view of someone's argument about the topic
- Problem (i.e., destablizing condition)
	- Motivates the essay, tells the reader why someone might write about this topic
	- Can be a gap in the accepted view, a misunderstanding in the accepted view, a problem with the question we've been asking, a contradiction in the accepted view, an unnoticed implication of the accepted view
- Thesis
	- Thesis is a structuring device to help the reader understand where the argument is going
	- Should be clearly and unambiguously stated
		- "In this paper, I will argue / show / demonstrate that …"
		- "Although Boyd argues X, his argument mistakenly assumes Y."
	- Usually best to briefly preview main points to help reader follow the paper
- Significance
	- Benefit of accepting the answer or solution offered (or the cost of not doing so)
	- A solution does not need to be grand, final, or revolutionary; it might be simply that an argument must be rejected
	- Avoid vague or generalizing statements
	- Significance is often elaborated in the conclusion
- Optional elements of a good introduction
	- Hook: anecdote, example, or question to grab your readers' attention
		- Don't obsess over your first sentence; don't try too hard to be catchy
		- If used, make sure the anecdote leads directly to your main point
	- Roadmap: indicating how you will develop your argument
		- Especially helpful for complex, multi-part arguments
		- For simpler arguments, thesis acts as a roadmap
	- Concession / limitation of scope: why the accepted view isn't entirely wrong or why you will only focus on part of the problem
	- Anticipated questions / objections: particularly helpful if you expect a strong pushback against your argument
		- Usually only included in a roadmap
- Checklist for reviewing your introduction
	- Does your introduction contain sufficient context about the accepted view to help your intended readers understand your argument?
		- Does it contain elements of summary that are not needed to introduce my point?
	- In sketching a problem, are you addressing a real problem or are you overgeneralizing or setting up a straw man?
	- Does your introduction contain a clear, specific thesis statement, i.e. a solution to the problem you have outlined?
	- Does it contain a sentence that summarizes the significance of your argument?
- Checklist for reviewing your introduction
	- Is your introduction longer than ca. 15% of your paper?
	- Does what you promise in the introduction actually map on to what you say in the body of the paper?
		- Always revise your introduction at the end!
	- Does any of the material in your introduction overlap with material in your conclusion?
		- If so, consider whether it introduces your argument or sums it up, and move it to the most appropriate section.
- Exercise: Haybron's introduction
	- Look at the introduction to Haybron's chapter on Emotional States and try to find the following elements (they may not all be there):
		- Hook
		- Accepted view
		- Problem
		- Solution (thesis)
		- Significance
		- Concession / limitation of scope
		- Roadmap
		- Anticipated questions / objections
	- Is this a good introduction overall? (How) could it be improved?
- example student introductions:

		- > On the Appeal of Sad Music: Why is Non-representational Sad Music Enjoyable?
			- > In his book “Poetics”, Aristotle proposes the paradox of tragedy, which refers to the phenomenon of finding enjoyment in witnessing artistic portrayals of tragedies. Even though these portrayals elicit negative emotions that cause humans disturbance, we still choose to engage with them. One such artistic portrayal of tragedies can be found in sad music, wherein sadness is reported as the dominant feeling in a listener’s experience. Listeners’ engagement with sad music seems to go against the human tendency towards pleasure and happiness as well as our attempt to avoid discomfort and negative emotions in our daily lives. Noticeably, most theories that aim to explain this paradox are concerned mostly with artworks that have a narrative and convey certain lessons for the audience, such as dramas, films, or music with lyrics. The lessons learned from stories in these artworks are one of the sources of pleasure for the audience (Huron and Vuoskoski, 2020). In light of this, Huron and Vouskoski (2020) raise the question of how non-representational sad art such as instrumental music, while lacking a narrative, can still evoke enjoyment in listeners. Huron and Vuoskoski then propose that in the case of sad instrumental music, listeners can still feel pleasure when listening to it because sad instrumental music evokes compassion (a positive emotion) in addition to sadness.
			- > Moreover, to explain for whom listeners of sad instrumental music feel compassion, Huron and Vuoskoski cite the human ability to assign intentions and emotions to visible non-human objects as the main reason. However, this explanation overlooks the fact that music is not a visible agent, and thus the way humans assign emotions to instrumental music might be different from the way humans assign emotions to visible objects. Furthermore, Huron and Vuoskoski do not specifically mention the cognitive mechanisms that allow listeners to assign emotions to instrumental music when listening to this music.

## Conclusions

	- DON'T
		- Bring in new arguments
		- Offer summary of the view you're responding to
		- Undercut your own work by introducing new doubts about your argument
