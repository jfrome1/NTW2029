# Empirical articles

Good question, and I will try to find time to write a Canvas page about this topic. If you are discussing an empirical article, it can be useful to point out methodological weaknesses in the study, but there are two things to watch out for:

1) your paper should be unified around a thesis, which must focus on one main idea. If your criticisms are linked to the same main idea, that's fine, but you don't want to have a laundry list of unrelated critiques. Remember, the point of an essay is to defend a positive claim (your thesis), not to make a list of problems with the source.

2) just as with a humanities article, you should point out weaknesses ONLY IF they relate to the source's main argument because you want your thesis to be more significant rather than less significant

Thanks for the question. See above answer. Also note that, while I am familiar with issues about experimental design, I am not trained in statistics, so any discussion about problems with the math must be written in a way that I can understand!
