This assignment is optional. If you submit it, you will receive feedback that can guide your writing process. There is no penalty for not submitting it.

## Assignment purpose

The assignment is designed to help you organize your thoughts for your draft. The assignment asks you to submit an outline, following rules designed to help you process the reading in a way that leads to a good draft. Since Paper 1 is an exposition paper in which you explain a source, the outline you submit for this assignment can be thought of as either an ouline of parts of the source or as an outline of Paper 1.

## Goals:

- practice paraphrasing and correct attribution
- practice reading course assignments closely and following all instructions
- develop an accurate understanding of the source material

## Outline structure

- At the top, state Pinker's main points for the sections and arguments you plan to discuss (not for the chapter as a whole). Use two sentences maximum.
- Include a correctly formatted reference list with only one source, Pinker, and format the citation for the source correctly.






- Attribute claims directly to the source (e.g., "Pinker argues that cooperation evolved...").
- Paraphrase all points; do not use direct quotations. Include page numbers or ranges for each point in parentheses (e.g., (22-23)).



## Scope:

The outline should not cover all of Pinker's arguments, only ones that you will discuss in your paper. See the main Paper 1 assignment for the expected scope of the paper.




## Checklist:

Logistics for this assignment only:

- State the source's thesis at the top (2 sentences maximum).
- Include a correctly formatted reference list (which will include only one source, Pinker)
- Follow the thesis with numbered/lettered lines in a hierarchical outline form. The exact number/letter scheme doesn't matter, but make sure each line has a unique indicator because I'll need to be able to easily refer to specific lines in the outline for my feedback. In this assignment, I'll call each numbered/lettered part of the outline a "point", but "point" refers to an indicator followed by sentence, not an idea in a general sense. (A point would be: "3a. Boyd claims that this experiment shows that cooperation is heritable.").
- Each numbered point is called a "main point" and lettered points indented underneath main points are "subpoints", and "point" without an adjective refers to both.
	- Avoid:
		- 1a. The appeal of Harlequin romance is universal, and is built on the historical and cross-cultural popularity of romance as a genre. (386-387)
		- 1b. Romance fiction is the most lucrative fiction category in the United States and is dominated by Harlequin Enterprises Limited, the largest publisher of romance novels internationally. (387)
		- 1c. Women make up 90% of the consumer base of romance fiction. (388)
		- _Problem: there is no main point summarizing the three subpoints. An appropriate main point might be: (1) Harlequin romances are a popular series of romance fiction that appeals primarily to women._


- Do not include source quotations. Use paraphrases only. Put the page number or range for each point at the end of that point. e.g. (22-23).
- Attribute your points to the correct source.	Write "Pinker says that cooperation evolved..." instead of writing "Cooperation evolved...".
- Each point will paraphrase a claim from the source argument.
- Each point in the outline should contain EXACTLY one complete sentence--not two or more sentences. Do not use more than one sentence per point in any circumstance.
	- Correct:
		- 1. Dance movements convey sex-specific information indicating an individual's biological quality (352).
			- A. Male physical strength may be a mating-related quality conveyed through dance as more elaborate dance movements are challenging and require a higher level of coordination to be executed (352-353).
			- B. In contrast, female dance movements may provide information about their fertility (353).
- Each point should be a COMPLETE sentence with a clear subject and verb, ending in a period—not a phrase or sentence fragment.
	- Avoid: "Adaptive traits from the EEA" [not a sentence]
	- Avoid: "What happens in modern society." [not a sentence]
	- Avoid:
		- 1. Action films and video games teach coping by:
			- a) Balancing negative and positive experiences and creating a hierarchy among them.
			- b) Integrating negative emotions into positive goals to pose activating challenges.
		- _Problem: (1) is not a complete sentence by itself. (A) and (B) are not complete sentences by themselves. The incorrect format encourages the student to make a list of points without really summarizing them into increasingly broad ideas._
- The subject of your point sentences should NOT be the source author, but a thing the author talks about (an idea or another author). This is very important! If you don't follow this rule you will likely end up describing the source as a piece of writing rather than actually summarizing its argument.
	- Avoid:
		- 1. The authors of this study assume that musicality is universal in human vocal communication.
			- a. To overcome the cultural variation in music, the authors focus on the universality of musicality since it's a product of our brain's physiology and psychology. (2)
		- _Problem: both points describe the assumptions or actions of the authors. Possible correction: (1) Musicality is universal in human vocal communication, (a) Despite the cultural variation in music, the universality of music can be explained because music is a product of humans' evolved brains._
- Avoid using "this" or "it" as the subject of the points
	- Avoid: "This is an example of mate selection." [What is an example of mate selection? Identify it clearly.]
- Each point should be a STATEMENT—not a question.
	- Avoid: "What does survival have to do with sexual selection?" [not a statement]
- Each point should make a claim about your TOPIC, it should NOT make a claim about what the source does in the paper. Yes, I am repeating this same point with additional examples because this guideline is so important.
	- Avoid: "Boyd gives several supporting examples."
	- Correct: "One modern mechanism for punishing cheaters is a police force." (stating the example)
	- Avoid: "Pinker gives several reasons that music is pleasurable."
	- Correct: "Music includes sounds similar to those found in the EEA" (written as if you are Pinker making this argument)
- Do not include lines about the paper introduction or conclusion in the outline. The thesis stated above the outline will serve as the introduction to the outline.
