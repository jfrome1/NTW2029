##### :x group chat

Good group chat questions:
- "Is the assignment due at noon or midnight?"
- "What's the difference between primary and secondary sources?"
- "Is anyone else having trouble accessing the reading?"
- "Did we need to include citations in the word count?"

Keep group messages focused on course content and logistics. Don't discuss individual grades or personal circumstances.

##### :x email tips

Write clear subject lines with the course code and topic: "NTW2029 - Extension Request for E03"

State your request immediately: "I'm requesting a 24-hour extension for E03 because I have two midterms on the same day. Would this be possible?" This acknowledges you're asking permission rather than announcing a decision.

I can answer specific questions like "Should I cite paraphrases?" or "Can I use British spelling?" However, I can't review draft sections or answer vague "is this okay?" questions via email. Those need a conference.

##### :x seeking support

Consider reaching out when you're:
- Consistently struggling to meet deadlines
- Not understanding content despite attending class
- Feeling overwhelmed by coursework
- Dealing with personal issues affecting studies

The earlier you reach out, the more options we have. Seeking help demonstrates good judgment - many successful students use these resources regularly.
