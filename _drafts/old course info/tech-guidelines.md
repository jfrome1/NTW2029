## NTW2029 website

The website https://ntw-2029.vercel.app/ is the primary way I give course information to the class. I've added password protection so I can find out and focus on improving the resources that students use most. Please email me if there is anything I can improve on the site (you will get class participation credit for this feedback).

## Canvas

Canvas is only for:

- submitting assignments
- discussion posts
- me providing feedback to you

You will notice that all assignments are set to "does not count towards the final grade". That's to prevent confusion, because the Canvas gradebook isn't set up to track your grades -- I do that on my own computer.

Notifications: set up Canvas notifications so you don't miss anything important. Use the linked instructions to set your [default notification](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-manage-my-Canvas-notification-settings-as-a-student/ta-p/434) or [notifications just for this course](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/How-do-I-manage-notifications-for-a-single-course/ta-p/615325).

Set notifications to `Daily` or `Immediately` for these categories:

- Due Date
- Discussion posts
- Announcements

You are welcome to get notified for "Course Content" but I frequently revise the site so you will get _lots_ of notifications if you do.

## Telegram

For out-of-class chat, we will use Telegram. I'll post the group link here when it's set up.

## Email

Follow these guidelines for emailing me:

- Subject line: Put the course code (e.g. NTW2029) in the subject line of EVERY email you send me so it will be filtered into the correct class email folder.
- Name: Use the name I call you in class in addition to your formal name so I know who you are right away.
- Tone: Be respectful. Don't send an email like you would message a friend, e.g. "Hey, I'm gonna be late, sry" is not ok. You don't have to be formal, but if you have a class conflict, ask permission to miss rather than just announcing it.
- Follow-up: I aim to respond to all emails within one business day.If you haven't heard from me, it's totally fine to email me again to remind me. I won't be annoyed. Sometimes an email just gets buried in my inbox.

## Digital calendar

- You _must_ have a calendar with your course due dates on it. If you don't currently use one, [:set it up right away](#x-calendar).

##### :x calendar

Every student I have had who forgot to submit an asssignment was one who didn't use a calendar. Some relied on memory; others had a to-do list. Your life may have worked just fine without a calendar until now. Now you need one. Set up a calendar, put all assignment due dates on it right at the beginning of the semester, check the calendar daily, and if your calendar is electronic, make sure to set up a default one-day advance reminder for assignment due dates.
