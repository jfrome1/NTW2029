title: Exercise 7 - P2 proposal conference summary
date: 2024-08-13

---

Please submit a post-conference summary of the most important points you took from our conference and from my recorded comments on your draft. There is no word count requirement; I'll leave it up to you.

Your summary should include:

1. the most important points of feedback you recieved in the conference
2. your planned next steps for your next assignment
3. (optional) any other comments or feedback for me

After this conference, you can still email me short questions that I can quickly answer. You can also request an in-person meeting and I'll do my best to accommodate you (max one follow-up conference per student). But I am not able to provide feedback on emailed drafts or paper sections before the final is due.
