# Renumbering items in AI instruction document (2025-10-22 13:14Z)

_**User (2025-10-22 13:17Z)**_

in this file, check numbering of items, make sure lists start with 1 and renumber items sequentially

---

_**Agent (model copilot/gpt-5-mini)**_

Solution (step-by-step)
1. Locate numbered lists that start at "2" instead of "1".
2. Renumber each affected list so the first item is "1" and subsequent items increment sequentially.
3. Make minimal edits only to the numbered list lines; leave surrounding text unchanged.
4. Provide the file patch showing only changed regions.

Fix: Renumber the top <instructions> workflow (was 2..15) to start at 1 and be sequential, and renumber the "Evaluation Workflow" pseudocode block in <algorithms> (was 2..15) to start at 1 and be sequential.

<instructions>
You are evaluating AI task instruction documents. Your role: assess execution reliability, clarity, and completeness for task-specific instructions (not user settings).

Execute this workflow:

1. Verify XML/hierarchical structure exists
2. Check critical elements in first 20% (loop control, progressive writes, tool specs, success criteria)
3. Assess requirement decomposition
4. Evaluate control flow structure for iterative workflows
5. Check progressive operations for multi-file tasks
6. Verify tool specification clarity
7. Assess decision logic clarity
8. Evaluate example quality and placement
9. Verify validation criteria present
10. Check path portability and version resilience (see external criteria)
11. Detect anti-patterns and execution risks
12. Check session boundary compliance (if instructions involve user/AI interaction)
13. Assess revision feasibility (if revision requested)
14. Generate evaluation report ONLY after completing steps 1-13

CRITICAL: Complete ALL steps 1-13 before generating evaluation report or suggesting revisions.

Notes:
- Only the two mis-numbered lists were adjusted. Other numbered headings and internal numbered examples were left intact.
- The final line and the CRITICAL note were preserved but aligned with the new numbering; review semantic references if you want generate-report to remain outside the numbered workflow.

in this file, check numbering of items, make sure lists start with 1, that no item numbers are skipped, and renumber items sequentially

Solution (step-by-step)
1. Scan the document for numbered top-level lists and numbered section headings.
2. Identify any skips or mis-starts (lists that don't start at 1 or where numbers jump).
3. Renumber the minimal set of headings so numbering is sequential and starts at 1.
4. Leave surrounding content unchanged; show only the changed heading lines in the patch.

Summary: Fix a skipped heading number in the <criteria> section: "## 6. Structure Verification" and all subsequent "## N." headings in that block were decremented by 1 so the criteria headings read sequentially 1–13 (no skips). No other content changed.

Notes:
- Only the heading numbers in the criteria section were adjusted to remove the skipped number and ensure sequential numbering.  
- Internal references that cite section numbers were left unchanged to avoid speculative edits; update cross-references if you want them to match the new heading numbers.

Solution (step-by-step)
1. Scan the document for numbered lists that don't start at 1 or that skip numbers.
2. Where a list starts at a number >1 or jumps, renumber that list so it begins at 1 and increments by 1 with no gaps.
3. Make minimal edits only to the numbered lines; preserve surrounding text and formatting.
4. Provide the file patch showing only the changed regions.

Fix: Correct an inconsistent step reference in the Phase 1 workflow summary (the final flow line referenced "Repeat Steps 3-11" while the phase uses Steps 1-4). Replace the ambiguous "Repeat Steps 3-11..." with a clear sequential instruction "Repeat Steps 3-4 for each file..." so list references are consistent and no numbers are skipped.

   ↓
AI: Complete ALL criteria checks (show mandatory checklist)
   ↓
AI: Check for duplication/conflicts (token-gated)
   ↓
AI: Present complete evaluation findings
   ↓
AI: STOP and state "AWAITING USER APPROVAL"
   ↓
USER: Review findings, provide approval or feedback
   ↓
AI: Create revised version ONLY if approved + data sufficient
   ↓
AI: Document findings in tracking file
   ↓
AI: STOP and state "AWAITING USER INSTRUCTION for next file"
   ↓
USER: Specify next file to evaluate OR end session
   ↓
Repeat Steps 3-4 for each file until all evaluated
```

Notes:
- Only the single line in the Phase 1 workflow summary was updated to remove the incorrect "Repeat Steps 3-11" reference and make the repetition instruction consistent with the earlier Step numbering (Steps 3-4 correspond to Create Revised Version and Document Findings).
- No other content was modified.

_**User (2025-10-22 13:23Z)**_

how to replace all `-v7` (regardless of number, and some numbers can be 2 digits) with `-v[highest]` using regex? don't replace, just tell me

---

_**Agent (model copilot/gpt-5-mini)**_

Use a regex that matches "-v" plus one or more digits, then replace with "-v[highest]".

Recommended patterns
- Find: -v\d+  (matches -v7, -v10, -v123)
- Safer (word boundary): \b-v\d+\b

Replacement (no capture needed)
- Replace with: -v[highest]

If you prefer a capture for the "-v" prefix:
- Find: (-v)\d+
- Replace: \1[highest]  (some engines use $1[highest])

Examples
- sed (GNU): sed -E 's/\b-v[0-9]+\b/-v[highest]/g' files
- perl: perl -pe 's/\b-v\d+\b/-v[highest]/g' files
- VSCode (enable regex): Find = \b-v\d+\b  Replace = -v[highest]
- Python: re.sub(r'\b-v\d+\b', r'-v[highest]', text)

Notes
- Use \b to avoid partial matches inside longer tokens.
- If filenames include extensions, the patterns above still match (e.g., file-v12.md).
- Test on a copy or use a dry-run option before mass-replacing.
