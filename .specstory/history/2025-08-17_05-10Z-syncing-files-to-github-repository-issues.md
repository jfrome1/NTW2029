# Syncing files to GitHub repository issues (2025-08-17 05:10Z)

_**User (2025-08-17 05:12Z)**_

why didn't my files in ntw2029/public/downloads sync to my repo

Likely causes (your root .gitignore doesn’t ignore public/downloads):

- Files were never staged/committed. Check with: git status
- They’re ignored by a nested or global ignore. Check which rule with: git check-ignore -v public/downloads/** and also inspect .git/info/exclude and your global ignore (git config --get core.excludesfile)
- The folder is (effectively) empty. Git doesn’t track empty dirs; add a placeholder like .gitkeep.
- One or more files exceed 100MB, so GitHub rejected them. Use Git LFS or reduce size.
- You didn’t push the commit/branch. Verify with: git log origin/HEAD..HEAD and git push

Quick steps:
1) git status
2) git check-ignore -v public/downloads/**
3) If ignored, adjust/remove the rule (or add an exception) and run: git add -f public/downloads/**
4) If empty, create public/downloads/.gitkeep and commit
5) If large, install Git LFS and: git lfs track "public/downloads/*"; then add/commit/push

Want me to add a .gitkeep in public/downloads and whitelist that folder in .gitignore?
