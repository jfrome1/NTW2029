Thesis guidelines:

## Scope

- In a paper of this length, to discuss your topic at a sufficient level of specificity, you must identify a topic that is quite narrow. The types of topics academics discuss are complicated, and academic writing demands a high level of rigor and specificity. Thus, in order to add to an academic conversation, you must discuss the topics in depth, looking not at broad conclusions of general statements, but digging into the specifics of argumentative claims and their justifications, evaluating possible counter arguments. This type of writing requires spending much longer on relatively narrow points than you are probably used to. In other words, compared to your previous writing, you will be discussing a much narrower topic in much greater depth with much greater care and precision. You will not be taking a position on a topic and merely citing some authorities that support your view or briefly giving a few reasons your position might be correct. You will be discussing a topic that is narrow and complicated enough that the paper will first need to spend some time simply setting the stage to let the reader know the relevant concepts and context needed to analyze your narrow topic, and only then will you introduce your own ideas that add to the conversation.
- Examples
	- too broad:
	- appropriate:
- If your paper aims to explain a phenomenon, your explanation should apply to a specific narrow phenomenon and should NOT apply to a much broader version of that phenomenon, because if it does, then your paper is really proposing an explanation of that broader phenomenon rather than anything about the distinct features of the narrower one.
	- e.g. you propose a theory that people like detective fiction because they enjoy imagining escaping into another world, but if this explanation is true, then your theory explains why people like all fiction, and no longer explains anything specific about detective fiction
	- e.g. you propose a theory that people like upbeat dance music because the rhythm is like a baby's fast heart beat, but why doesn't this instead explain why people like upbeat music in general? Maybe your paper should argue for that thesis instead.
- if you are proposing a theory explaining a phenomenon, and saying that it is better than an alternate theory, you must either 1) show why the other theory is bad in ways that don't also apply to your theory or 2) show that your theory and the other theory cannot both be true and your theory is better than the other theory even if you don't note any particular problems with that theory
- don't try to narrow your topic too much at the beginning; rather, keep in mind ways that you might narrow your topic as you read to find sources, and you may be able to narrow it based on the source you choose to analyze
	- e.g. you might be reading someone's theory about why audiences like live performance, and as you think about it, you might realize that their arguments apply well to theater but not to music performance; you can take that as a cue to focus your paper on live theater rather than music (or, it might make you consider why the theory doesn't apply to music and you might look for a different theory)
- consider that there may be many reasons for certain phenomena, such as the fact that audiences like to watch sad films and play violent videogames, and you need to understand the academic conversations around such topics to be able to effectively contribute to them
	- why does this phenomenon require an explanation?
- How speculative or empirically supported your argument should be is based on the specific details of your research question and the relevant academic conversation.
	- Are you trying to explain a phenomenon that is puzzling, counterintuitive, or surprising to most people? If so, you are aiming to add to the conversation by suggesting a possible explanation for why the phenomenon makes sense. You can be more speculative and can look to meet a standard of plausibility. The more detailed and falsifiable your theory is, while still being supported with compelling reasons, the more speculative you can be while still adding to the conversation. The factual claims used to support your theory should be either uncontroversial or should be empirically supported by published research you cite.
	- Are you trying to explain a phenomenon that seems obvious or unsurprising to most people? If so, you are aiming to add to the conversation by providing a richer, more detailed, and/or more empirically supported version of the type of ordinary explanation most people could provide.

	 (i.e. a vague theory with few distinctions doesn't add much to folk psychology)

- main common problems
- descriptive claims vs. content claims
	- Your thesis should make claims about the content of the academic conversation.
	- Your thesis claims should not be claims about what you plan to do in the paper.
	- e.g., avoid:
		- "I seek to establish similarities and mark out differences between the two theories about why we enjoy sad films."
		- "I will use various ideas in Evolutionary Psychology (EP) to ground my argument as to why audiences like both recorded and live theater."
		- "I will explore how..."
		- "I deconstruct the concept of..."
		- avoid all theses that are of this type!
- thesis "they say" is a claim about the source as a piece of writing or how readers might respond (avoid) rather than about the source's content, arguments, or claims (correct)
		- e.g. avoid: "Their argument is unlikely to persuade skeptics due to them overlooking several factors."
		- e.g. avoid: "I will argue that there are several weaknesses in the view that group selection theory still applies today."
		- e.g. better: "I will argue that group selection theory is less applicable to modern day society due to the growth of the internet."
		- if you have specific points of criticism, specify them in the thesis rather than referring to them indirectly
		- if you have multiple points of criticism, unify them under a common theme

## Rubric — Conception and articulation of thesis statement

Excellent

- the thesis statement is clearly organized around a "they say/I say" structure
- the thesis makes the "I say" response strategy clear (disagree, agree and disagree, agree with a difference)
- both the "they say" and "I say" elements of the thesis reference specific claims that are part of the content of the relevant academic conversation
- neither the "they say" nor the "I say" elements of the thesis are 1) merely topics or concepts rather than specific claims, 2) claims about what the student's paper plans to do, 3) claims that are about the source text's general quality, persuasiveness, or ability to be improved
- if the "they say" or "I say" part of the thesis contains more than one point, subpoints are connected to a unified main idea and are specified to give the reader an idea of the paper's strategy and organization

Good

- the thesis statement meets most of the listed criteria, but is lacking in one or more of them, or accomplishes all of them in a less polished way
- e.g. the "I say" subpoints are clearly articulated but are not unified towards one main idea
- e.g. the "they say" summary words the source's main claim in a misleading or ambiguous way, but the body paragraphs reflect a proper understanding of the claim

Satisfactory

- the thesis statement clearly fails to meet one of the listed criteria, but does so in a way that still allows a successful paper that meets the goals of the assignment
- e.g. the thesis does not identify the specific argumentative claim that will be analyzed, referring to it as "the argument about altruism," but the body paragraphs make the claim and response clear
- or, the paper slightly misses several of the listed criteria

Acceptable

- the thesis statement misses several of the listed criteria, but does so in a way that still allows an otherwise acceptable paper that meets the goals of the assignment
- e.g. neither the "they say" nor the "I say" elements of the thesis reference specific claims, but instead refer to concepts or general problems with "arguments and examples"

Unsatisfactory

- the thesis statement fails to meet one or more of the listed criteria, and does so in a way that prevents the paper from meeting the goals of the assignment
- e.g., the thesis makes a claim about whether the source could be improved in general, or would persuade a skeptical reader



5)	Thesis tips
a)	If your thesis claim is true of many videogames, not just the one you are analyzing, then your paper doesn't tell us enough about your game specifically. e.g. "Videogame X creates a scary atmosphere with disgusting monsters and dark lighting."
b)	Your thesis should not be an evaluation of whether a game is good or bad--it is not a review
c)	Your thesis cannot be a description of what you intend to do. "This essay will analyze how game mechanics interact with narrative elements of the game" is NOT a thesis. It is just telling me that you intend to make an argument later. What is the CONCLUSION of your analysis? That conclusion is the thesis.
d)	You shouldn't argue that game X shows that videogames are better/worse than other media. Instead, you could argue how game X shows that videogames are different than other media in specific ways A, B, and C. (but not OBVIOUS ways A, B, and C).
e)	Two strategies for making an interesting thesis claim are:
i)	explain how obvious aspects of a game lead to non-obvious effects
(1)	e.g. how does a game mechanic that is different from other games in the same genre cause big changes in play style?
ii)	explain how obvious effects of the game are caused in non-obvious ways (this often means providing a detailed explanation of how various elements of the game contribute to this effect)
(1)	e.g. why does a survival horror game that is supposed to be scary fail it its attempts to be scary?
f)	Some e.g. bad theses and why:
i)	"This game has feature X because…"
(1)	The only way to know why a game has a certain feature is if the developers tell you the reason. If they do, then you might mention this point in your paper, but it cannot be the thesis of the paper—there is not enough to say about it.
(2)	Instead of saying WHY the game has feature X, explain what the EFFECTS of feature X are.
ii)	"This game is fun because of..."
(1)	"Fun" is totally subjective. What exactly do you mean by "fun"?
iii)	"This game is popular because of features X and Y."
(1)	You cannot know why a game is popular without doing research on the players through surveys.
iv)	"This essay will discuss why *1979 Revolution: Black Friday- works better as a game than a book in certain aspects."
(1)	Don't describe what you plan to do. State your conclusion. Make an argument. No one can disagree with this sentence, because that is what the paper is going to do. So this is not an argumentative thesis, which is required for the paper. Tell me the specific aspects you are going to talk about. And don't use an ambiguous phrase like "works better". What exactly does that mean?
v)	"The objective of this essay is to study these game mechanisms of Pokémon Emerald to illustrate the why, an old game remains an abiding popularity."
(1)	problems are 1) it is just saying that the paper will study/analyze something, which is not an argument, and provides no information, and 2) it says it will explain why the game is popular. Do not talk about why the game is popular! You cannot find that out by doing an analysis.
vi)	"My paper is going to discuss the saving system in this game. I will argue that *NieR: Automata*'s saving system is a failure in this game. And I will support my thesis from several aspects and evidences as examples in the following parts."
(1)	this thesis is far too wordy and leaves out the most important part: the points the author is going to use to support their thesis. It should just be, "This game's saving system undermines its ability to X because of reasons A, B, and C."
vii)	"The paper would like to analysis a game called *Beholder- that presents how the issues create certain effects and contributes the whole game style."
(1)	This sentence does not tell me anything. Just start by telling me what you are going to say about the certain effects and game style.
viii)	"The paper would like to analysis the core mechanics in three aspects found in the gameplay: the variation of the choice of options, the object inventory, and the multi-tasking. The paper is going to explain how the choice of options related to those aspects in order to affect the player's experience."
(1)	Pretty good, but too wordy, and it doesn't actually tell us the effect of these aspects. The three aspects are also not clear. Maybe instead: "There are three core mechanics that work together to encourage players to feel X: change in action options, the presentation of objects in the inventory, and the requirement that players multi-task."
ix)	"Comparing these 2 car racing games, the elements that are included in the game FH3 are more diverse than those in NFS, in several ways: the mission types, the types of cars, the different maps, and the customization options."
(1)	Clear and previews the argument--good. BUT, does not seem to be argumentative, and the observation is fairly obvious.
