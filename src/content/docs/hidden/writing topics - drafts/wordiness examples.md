	> First and foremost, in concluding that women are more inherently prone to artisticality than men, Varella et al. conducted an extensive review of past research related to art-related skills and behaviours. However, I do not think that the evidence they quoted can allow us to reasonably come to the same conclusion. One example of evidence that they quoted was a book by Ellis et al. (2008), which is a comprehensive meta-analysis of the available literature on sex differences and similarities in humans and other species. Based on the book, females demonstrated stronger preferences for fashion, television, and other forms of art. Other studies were also referenced to highlight this point (e.g., Holahan et al., 1995; Varella et al., 2010), as well as the occupational choices of each sex (e.g., Su, Rounds, & Armstrong, 2009). However, in establishing whether a trait is inherent or learnt over time, we must note the importance of distinguishing between nature versus nurture.
