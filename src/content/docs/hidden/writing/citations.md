## Purpose of citation

- Proper citations are essential for an author's credibility.
	- They demonstrate to readers that the author got their information from credible sources.
	- They convey the message, "I have nothing to hide. If you don't trust my claims about these sources, you can go check them yourself."
	- Lack of proper citations (including proper formatting) suggests that the author didn't produce the paper with attention to detail.
- Citations help your readers.
	- Readers need a way to easily find the sources you are discussing so they can confirm whether they agree with your interpretation of those sources.
	- Readers doing research in the same area will want to be able to find your sources.
	- Readers often skim reference lists to quickly check if a paper references important and recent sources.
- Citations give fair credit to the original source of ideas being discussed, and this type of recognition is one of the few rewards scholars get for their research.

## When is citation required?

- In this course, citations are required for all papers and paper-related assignments but not for other assignments unless explicitly requested.
- Provide citations to the original source whenever you use others' ideas, regardless of where you got them (whether published, online, or personal communication).
- Most plagiarism is unintentional; students may not know when they must cite sources, but failure to cite can have serious consequences, including failing the course. Your are responsible for knowing when and how to cite your sources.
- Citation is required whether you use the exact words of a source (quotation) or state the idea in your own words (paraphrase/summary). Read section 14.6 of [_The Craft of Research_](https://go.exlibris.link/fFKws0JQ) for clarification and examples.
- Citation exception 1: you don't need to cite sources for common knowledge or obvious observations
	- e.g. of needless citation: "These games are based on player skill and performance (Grodal, 2003), focusing on how players experience and perform in the game. Fitness-related stimuli like obstacles and actions are aplenty. Not performing these actions well can result in failure to meet gameplay objectives, such as clearing a level or defeating a boss enemy. Failure often results in loss of life, energy, or game termination (Juul, 2009)."
	- It is common knowledge that failing in a videogame often results in losing a game life.
- Citation exception 2: you don't need to cite any ideas I give you, in or out of class, in assignments submitted to me unless you are referencing something I published.
- You commit plagiarism if you fail to properly cite your sources. All students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offenses under the USP code of academic conduct, which can be consulted at <http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/plagiarism>.

## How to cite sources for this course

There are two parts to citing sources: a reference list with full citation information at the end of the paper and in-text citations in the paper's body paragraphs.

<details><summary>Do not make the following mistakes:</summary>

- Trusting online and software citation tools. These tools*cannot be trusted*; they often have bad information or make mistakes. YOU must proofread your citations against the actual rules of your paper's formatting style, which are provided below. You are responsible for confirming that the citations are correct.
- Coping the citations I use on Canvas or handouts. I often deviate from proper format for course-related reasons, such as specifying a chapter in a book. Proper citations in a paper reference list don't specify book chapters; you just cite the book as a whole.

</details>

<details>
	<summary> Reference list: use APA formatting</summary>

- Assignments should format the reference list in accordance with American Psychological Association (APA) formatting rules. The paper should not follow other aspects of the APA style, such as in-text citation or paper formatting. For those elements, follow the course guidelines.
Proper reference list formatting includes two elements: formatting the list itself and formatting the individual entries on the list (the citations). Check rules for both elements.
- You can review APA rules many places online, including [here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/index.html).
- You can download a handout with APA formatting instructions [here](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/documentation/docapa/). The section about reference list formatting is section 7. Ignore other sections of the handout.
- APA guidelines on citing book chapters is [here](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/book-chapters)
- Students often have problems with formatting the reference list because they copy and paste text into the list from other documents. Double-check your fonts (use only one), spacing, line breaks, italics, and other formatting elements.
- <details><summary> IMPORTANT: For URLs, you MUST locate and use the official publisher's URL or DOI link for the source.</summary>

	- You cannot simply cite the source based on the webpage where you found it. Many places online allow researchers to publish accessible versions of their research, such as ResearchGate, academia.edu, CiteSeerx, or university repositories, but those are not appropriate locations to cite. If you cannot find the original publication, the source might just be a paper someone uploaded rather than a peer-reviewed publication.
	- To locate the correct URL for an article, search for the article title on the NUS library website. If you don't find the article right away, search for the name of the journal the article appeared in on the NUS library website and click through to the journal webpage. Then use either the volume and issue number, the date, or the general search function to find your specific article.

<details><summary> In-text citations guidelines (adapted from APA handout in Reference List section)</summary>

- Parenthetical (in-text) citations should appear in the body of your text whenever you write information that came from a source. In-text citations include authors' last names, the year that the source was published, and the page number where the cited information came from.
- The basic in-text citation format you should use is (Last Name, YEAR, page number), and the sentence period/full stop should always go after the last parentheses when the citation is at the end of the sentence.
- <details><summary> This format changes based on a few additional rules:</summary>

	- Does the source have more than one author?
		- (Alibali, 2019, 37) – for one author
		- (Alibali & Moore, 2019, 37) – for two authors
		- (Alibali et al., 2019, 37) – for more than two authors
		- note that in "et al." nothing is capitalized, there's a space between "et" and "al" and there's a period after "al" regardless of any additional punctuation
	- Do you cite the source more than once in the paper?
		- If there is only one source with by the same author, then you include the year of the source only the first time you cite/mention it, because the reader can use that first mention to clearly identify the source in your reference list.
		- e.g., "Alibali's (2019) mixed-methods study found that children represent mathematical problems best on paper (20). Alibali concluded that computers should not be used to teach elementary math (31)." (you don't need the year in the second sentence)
	- Did you already mention the author and year in the sentence?
		- If so, put just the page number in parentheses after the cited information:
			- e.g., "In 2019, Alibali used mixed methods to study how children represent mathematical problems (20)."
	- Are you citing the source as a whole rather than a particular idea from that source?
		- If so, no page number is needed.
		- e.g., "Researchers have studied how children represent mathematical problems (Alibali & Moore, 2019)."
	- Did you already mention the author in the sentence?
		- If so, don't put the name again in the in-text citation; put the year directly after the author's name and put the page number separately after the cited information, usually at the end of the sentence:
			- e.g., "Alibali's (2019) mixed-methods study found that children represent mathematical problems best on paper (20)"
			- e.g., "In a case study of a 3rd-grade classroom, Zhang (2017) explored the implementation of a new curriculum (5)."
	- There are lots of uncommon exceptions or additional rules (e.g., when you have two authors with the same last name, two works with the same authors published in the same year, personal communication, indirect sources, etc.). Don't attempt to guess the correct way to handle these; after confirming that these guidelines don't answer your questions, proactively ask me how to do the citation. It is ok in these rare cases.
	- It's not necessarily helpful to correctly format all your in-text citations as you draft your paper. In fact, sometimes interrupting your writing to go look up a specific date or page could distract your focus. I usually put (YYYY) or (p) if I don't have the information handy when drafting.

## Citations and grading

- Papers not using proper format for in-text citations and the reference list will incur a grade penalty.
- I am happy to look at your citations in person.
- DO NOT EMAIL ME YOUR CITATIONS and ask me to check them for you unless you have an unusual situation that is not covered by the guidelines here (in which case it is ok). I have provided very clear instructions, there is tons of additional guidance online, librarians and writing tutors exist. You can do this. And again, do NOT trust software reference tools; if they worked well, I would tell you to use them, but they are not reliable.

## Reference list example

Find an example properly formatted paper [here](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/55149/files/3357815?wrap=1).

## Citations checklist

- include in-text citations for paraphrasing AND quotations (not just quotes; should have at least a few in-text citations in almost every paragraph)
- check reference list (hanging indents, spacing, etc.)
- check items in reference list (APA style, correct italics, etc.)
- check in-text citations using instructions above  (names mentioned only as necessary, no "p.", etc.)

<details><summary> My paper aims to propose an alternative to De Backer's (2012) "eye-witness-I-witness" theory on PSRs. She does not dwell on the difference between fictional and non-fictional media characters, simply stating that while "readers often establish bonds with fictitious characters in books," "visuals play the most important role" in PSR formation.
</summary>
- problem: no page number citations
</details>
<details><summary> The MSB theory argues that "musicality" or the ability to create or perceive music was selected for because it promotes social bonding, accommodating increasing size and complexity of human social structures. In their article, social bonding is defined as the "formation, strengthening, and maintenance" of bonds with other individuals, bonds which form the basis of cooperative behavior. The definition that Savage et al. provide is broad, encompassing "bonding processes" and "their effects" (Savage et al., 2021, p. 2). Savage et al. argue that music is a bonding mechanism akin to grooming and gossiping as proposed by Dunbar (1993).
</summary>
- problem: author name repeated in in-text citation, year incorrectly included
</details>
<details><summary> According to Fredrickson in 1998, when hominids were transitioning to bipedalism around 4 million years ago, the environment that they lived in became more open and dispersed, with poorer-quality food eaten.
</summary>
- problem: year should be in parentheses, no page number provided
</details>
<details><summary> In "Origins of Music in Credible Signalling" (Mehr et. al. 2020), Mehr et. al. introduces a set of criteria to determine whether claims about the origins of music are complete claims.
</summary>
- problem: no need to mention author's name twice
</details>
<details><summary> Robin Dunbar discusses his view that music evolved to create and maintain social bonds in his 1991 paper "Functional Significance of Social Grooming in Primates" (Dunbar 1991).
</summary>
- problem: no need to mention author's name or paper year twice
</details>
<details><summary> One such theory is the sexual selection hypothesis, which proposes that musicality is the biological propensity that was shaped by sexual selection (Miller, G., 2000, 1). Studies supporting the sexual selection hypothesis have revealed that there is a positive correlation between perceived mate value and Musical Performance Quality (MPQ) during ovulation (Charlton, B.D., 2014, 4). Additionally, other studies have highlighted that musicality and MPQ suggest greater health, intelligence, social class, and parenting abilities, which improves mate value (Madison et al., 2018, 9).
</summary>
- problem: no need to put first initials on single-author in-text citations
</details>
<details><summary> The validity of these music universals were later confirmed by other evolutionary psychologists, like Savage et al. (2015) (1).
</summary>
- problem: year and page number should be in one set of parentheses, not two

## In-text citation: style (advanced)

- When citing a source, when should you mention the source author(s) name(s) in the sentence vs. in the parenthetical in-text citation?
- When citing a source, when should you mention contextual information about a source vs. just mentioning the name?
- When citing a source, when should you mention the source's entire name vs. just the last name?
- How often should you include in-text citations in one paragraph when explaining a source's argument? Every sentence?
	- guiding principles:
		- the reader should be able to easily understand the source of the idea in a sentence (the author's vs. a source)
		- too much citation information in a sentence can interfere with the smooth flow of reading
- How to cite ideas from source B that you learned from source A telling you about something source B says?
