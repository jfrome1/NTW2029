## Writing assistance and instruction

The NUS Libraries Writers' Centre offers peer tutoring for your academic writing in any division or course as well as for creative and extra-curricular writing projects. A consultation at the Writers' Centre is a friendly, non-judgmental conversation about your writing with a tutor who is trained to help you at any stage of your process. You can go in with anything from a vague idea to a complete draft and your tutor will work with you to set goals, suggest effective writing and revision strategies, and identify the next steps you can take. Book an appointment with a peer tutor here: https://nus.mywconline.com/.

## Software for academic writing

- Grammar checkers and other automated editing tools—should you use them?
	- Yes and no. Yes, is a good idea to use these types of tools as a way to highlight possible issues with your writing. No, it is not a good idea to automatically assume that the issues they highlight are actual problems or that you should make the changes they suggest. I recommend you use these tools as I do: use them to highlight instances of possible writing problems that you may have overlooked, but for each instance, use your own judgment to determine whether there actually is a problem, and if there is, whether it should be corrected in the way the software suggests.
	- Some students have asked whether the paid versions of these tools are worth spending money on. I honestly have no experience comparing the free and paid versions of these tools. Microsoft Office 365 has built-in editing tools for grammar and writing suggestions, and those may be sufficient. If any of you come across a resource that has compared the quality of these tools at a non-superficial level, please send me a link.
- Reference manager: use free, open source, cross-platform [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). It works as well or better than proprietary for-profit programs like Endnote or Mendeley.
	- instructions for configuring and getting started with Zotero are [here](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/c.php?g=145733&p=955213)
	- I use and recommend two extensions for Zotero, [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/) for helping manage .pdfs, and, if you want to be a "power user", [Zutilo](https://github.com/wshanks/Zutilo) to add advanced features and manage keyboard shortcuts
- Notetaking
	- Although I take some notes directly on article .pdfs, I do most of my notetaking in separate text files using an Markdown text editor. Some free ones I can recommend trying are [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), and [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/).
- Locating relevant sources
	- I used to recommend [Connected Papers | Find and explore academic papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) but it recently went to a freemium model where you must pay to build more than 5 graphs per month, so I'm looking for a substitute to recommend.
	- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is free and can find connections between sources, but has less functionality and requires more work. I still use it frequently, however.
	- Others I have not had a chance to try yet include:
		- [Using Citations to Explore Academic Literature | Inciteful.xyz](https://inciteful.xyz/)
		- [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/)
		- [9 Innovative Literature Mapping Tools Every Researcher Needs to Know](https://researcherssite.com/9-innovative-literature-mapping-tools-every-researcher-needs-to-know/) lists others as well
