- questions that led to evolutionary theory
	- why is there such diversity of life (DOL) in the world (i.e. so many kinds of plants and animals)?
	- why do species seem so well-matched with their environments, as if designed for those environments?
- what is a species?
	- informal definition: a group or type of plant or animal, like palm tree, tiger, rabbit, sunflower, human
	- formal definition: a group of organisms that can breed with each other but cannot breed with others outside the group
- 1st explanation for DOL (pre-1700s)
	- God created all species in their current forms and they are well-matched to their environments due to God's plan
- fossils
	- preserved remains of long-dead organisms
	- study of fossils in 1700s began to change views of species
	- belief developed that fossils showed extinct species that were compared to modern species
	- led to new view that species might develop or change over long periods of time
- Darwin and evolution
	- Darwin's first book is _The Origin of Species_ and aimed to explain DOL
	- note, it was not _How Life Began_, and didn't try to explain how life started
	- Darwin's most important contribution not concept of evolution (which already existed) but proposing a mechanism that could explain the DOL and the apparent "design" of animals with a naturalistic (non-supernatural) explanation, natural selection
	- Darwin showed how a non-thinking process could produce something that seemed to require design (will be explained in videos for 1.2)
- "tree of life"
	- some who accepted the basic concept of evolution thought that God created a wide variety of species, and these species evolved over time, but did not think that all present species had evolved from a very limited number of past species
	- Darwin's new idea was that all modern species branched off from smaller numbers of earlier species
		- e.g., one species of finch became four species of finch because the four populations were separated and evolved in different ways
