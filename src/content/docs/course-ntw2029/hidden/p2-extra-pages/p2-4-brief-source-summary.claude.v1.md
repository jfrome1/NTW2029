## Assignment Purpose

This assignment helps you finalize your source selection and understand how it fits into its academic conversation, providing the foundation for your Paper 2 analysis.

## Detailed Guidance

### Basic Instructions

- Write in full sentences in a clear, formal style
- You don't need to do outside research; rely on your source and make inferences when necessary (but be clear when you are doing so)
- If you're unsure about your source, remember you can still change it later with approval

##### :x verify source is appropriate

Your source must:
- Be recent (published within the last 10 years)
- Be published in an academic journal or by an academic press
- Make an argumentative claim (not just a literature review)
- Contribute to a conversation about evolutionary psychology and art

To verify your source is appropriate:
- Check the introduction to confirm it makes a specific argument
- Review the literature review section to identify the academic conversation
- Make sure the source proposes and defends a thesis rather than just summarizing existing research

Need help identifying if a source is a literature review? Literature reviews typically:
- Have words like "review," "survey," or "overview" in the title
- Discuss many different theories without strongly advocating for one
- Come from handbooks or companions (e.g., "The Oxford Handbook of...")
- Aim to provide a broad overview rather than advance a specific argument

##### :x identify academic conversation

To identify and describe the academic conversation:
1. Look for sections where your source discusses previous research
2. Pay attention to how the author positions their work in relation to existing scholarship
3. Note which scholars they cite frequently and how they frame their own contribution

Key elements to include in your first paragraph:
- What phenomenon is being explained or explored?
- What knowledge gaps or puzzling aspects does your source identify?
- What previous explanations or theories does your source build upon or challenge?
- Why is the source author not satisfied with current knowledge?

Example: "According to Author (2022), the academic conversation about music and emotional regulation has focused primarily on individual listening experiences, with researchers like Smith (2018) and Jones (2020) emphasizing the role of personal associations. However, Author notes that this approach overlooks the evolutionary aspects of group music-making (3)."

##### :x describe contribution

To explain your source's contribution:
1. Identify the main thesis or argument
2. Note the research methods or approach
3. Explain how the source aims to add to the academic conversation

Key elements to include in your second paragraph:
- What specific argumentative thesis does the source propose?
- What evidence or reasoning supports this thesis?
- What methods did the researchers use (e.g., empirical study, theoretical analysis)?
- How does this contribution change or advance our understanding of the topic?

Example: "Author develops a new theoretical framework combining signal detection theory and evolutionary psychology to explain the persistence of dance in human cultures. Through analysis of cross-cultural dance patterns and comparative primate studies, Author argues that synchronized movement serves as a costly signal of group cohesion that evolved specifically to facilitate in-group cooperation (5-6)."
