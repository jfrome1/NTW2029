Most research articles summarize previous research in their introductions, to provide context regarding what other people have said in the academic conversation, and this section of an article is often referred to as a literature review.

However, there are also sources that are entirely literature reviews; they generally do not propose and defend theses but simply provide overviews of research in an area. They can be useful for getting a sense of the types of research being done.

:::warn
Literature review sources are NOT appropriate as a primary source for Paper 2 because they do not (usually) propose and defend a thesis. They synthesize research to help readers get an overview of a field.

You can often tell if a source is a literature review, even before you read it, by keeping an eye out for [:certain clues](#x-clues).

##### :x clues

Clues a source is a literature review:

- it is a chapter in an [:anthology](#x-anthology) or a [:handbook](#x-handbook)
- it presents no clear "they say" that the source is arguing against, or the "they say" is something like "some people might think" but doesn't include any arguments against what other scholars have published
- it lists a number of different theories about a topic but doesn't clearly defend a particular theory

##### :x anthology

Anthologies are books where each chapter is written by a different person. They have an editor (or editors), who often writes an introduction and/or a chapter of the book. The editor is responsible for editing the chapters and managing the project, and they are named on the front cover, e.g. "edited by Luicano Floridi". Chapters in anthologies are independent and are related only by general topic area. Anthology chapters are sometimes, but not always, literature reviews.

##### :x handbook

Handbooks are anthologies that aim to give researchers an overview of topics in a field, with each chapter about a different topic. Handbook chapters are almost always literature reviews.

Handbooks usually have words like "handbook", "guide to", and "companion to" in their titles, as well as a publisher's name, e.g.:

- _The Oxford handbook of philosophical methodology_
- _The Palgrave handbook of the philosophy of film and motion pictures_
- _The Routledge companion to video game studies_
- _The Routledge handbook of evolution and philosophy_
- _The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of computing and information_
