# Selecting a Suitable Source for Paper 2

In Paper 2, you'll need to "explain and analyze a recent, published academic argument about EP and art." The quality of your analysis depends heavily on picking an appropriate source. I've created this guide to help you choose a source that will let you produce a strong analytical paper.

## Basic Requirements (You Need All of These)

- Recent publication: Within the last ten years ([:exceptions can be made](#x-exceptions-can-be-made) if requested)
- Academic source (published in a peer-reviewed journal or as a chapter in a book from a university press or academic press)
- Appropriate format (an article or book chapter, not a whole book)
- Original: Not a source chosen by current or previous students (see [list on course website](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-02-sources))
- I must approve your source before the Paper 2 source summary deadline

## What Kind of Source Will Work Well?

For Paper 2, you need a source that makes and defends explanatory claims about evolutionary psychology and art. There are two main types of suitable sources:

### 1. Empirical Research Papers

These papers test specific hypotheses about why or how phenomena occur through data collection and analysis. Good empirical papers:

- Test causal hypotheses or explanatory mechanisms with original data
- Investigate why or how something happens, not just describe it or measure it
- Have a clear research methodology that you can evaluate

Example: a study that tests whether musical ability is attractive by asking participants to rate people's attractiveness based on photos, with one group of photos shown without music and one group shown photos while hearing music that they are told was performed by the person in the photo

### 2. Substantive Theoretical Arguments

These papers make and thoroughly defend specific explanatory claims. Good theoretical papers:

- Present clear causal claims or explanatory models
- Support these claims with substantial evidence
- Engage with alternative explanations
- Integrate multiple empirical studies to support theoretical claims
- Have enough depth for you to analyze critically

e.g., A paper arguing that music evolved specifically as a sexual selection mechanism, thoroughly examining evidence across cultures and addressing alternative explanations.

## What to Avoid

Don't choose sources that:

- Are primarily literature reviews (they synthesize existing research without making original arguments)
- Merely describe phenomena without explaining why or how they occur
- Briefly propose theoretical frameworks without substantial defense
- Ask whether a trait is primarily genetic or primarily cultural (these questions are too broad)

## How to Evaluate a Potential Source

When looking at a possible source, ask yourself:

1. Does the paper make clear explanatory claims?
   - Can you identify a specific thesis statement that explains why or how something occurs?
   - Is there a central argument you can point to and analyze?

2. Does the paper provide substantial evidence?
   - For empirical papers: Is there original data collection and analysis?
   - For theoretical papers: Is there thorough analysis of existing studies?

3. Does the paper have analytical depth?
   - Does it thoroughly examine its claims rather than merely proposing them?
   - Does it consider and address alternative explanations?

4. Can you identify specific aspects to analyze?
   - Are there clear methodological choices, assumptions, or interpretations you can evaluate?
   - Is there enough substance to support a 2250-2750 word analysis?

## Example: Evaluating a Potential Source

Here's how you might evaluate a paper:

**Paper: "The Evolution of Art Preferences: Testing the Sexual Selection Hypothesis"**

1. Explanatory Claims: The paper argues that art preferences evolved specifically as a mate selection mechanism. (This is a clear causal claim you can analyze)

2. Substantial Evidence: The authors conduct experiments across multiple cultures measuring how artistic skill influences mate choice. (There's original research to evaluate)

3. Analytical Depth: The paper examines alternative explanations (group bonding, skill display) and explains why the sexual selection model better fits their data. (They've considered competing theories)

4. Analyzable Aspects: The methodology can be evaluated for cultural bias, the authors' interpretation of data can be critically examined, and their conclusions can be assessed against other evolutionary explanations. (You have multiple angles for analysis)

## Finding Suitable Sources

- Search academic databases like JSTOR, PsycINFO, or Google Scholar
- Use search terms that include both subject matter (art, music, fiction) and theoretical approach (evolutionary psychology, sexual selection)
- Look for longer papers (15+ pages often indicates depth)
- Read abstracts carefully to identify papers making clear explanatory claims
- When in doubt, just ask me for guidance

Remember that in Paper 2, you need to engage with how your source contributes to an academic conversation. This means you need a source with substantive claims that you can thoroughly analyze.

## What's Next?

After finding a potential source, submit it for approval and start preparing your brief source summary, which will help you articulate how your source contributes to its academic conversation.

##### :x exceptions can be made

Your exception request email must answer these questions:

- did you search for more recent papers by the same author on a similar topic?
- did you search Google Scholar to see what more recent papers cite your source?
- did you check if there is an Elicit research report or EP lit review source posted on this website on your topic?
