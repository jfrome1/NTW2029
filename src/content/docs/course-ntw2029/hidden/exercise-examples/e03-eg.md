### Boyd pages 51-55

> Boyd argues that evolution can explain cooperation in social animals, including humans, and provides an account of how it might have evolved in stages. He begins by noting that people accept cooperation as an obviously good idea. He states that before the 1960s, those studying evolution assumed that cooperation could easily evolve because groups benefit from cooperative individuals. In the mid-1960s, however, William Hamilton and George Williams challenged this assumption. They argued that if one individual in a group behaves cooperatively while another behaves selfishly, the selfish individual is more likely than the cooperator to survive and pass on its genes, making it difficult for cooperation to become a widespread trait in a species.

>Similarly, Boyd notes, unconditional altruism could not evolve, because an organism with this trait would always forego reproduction of its own genes for the reproduction of others' genes. Yet, while it may be difficult to explain the evolution of cooperation, and it is true that unconditional cooperation could not evolve, Boyd notes that conditional cooperation has evolved, and he aims to explain how.
>
> Boyd states that the first evolutionary step leading towards cooperation is mutualism, in which individuals help each other as they pursue their own interests. Prey species, for example, evolved a preference for being near others of their species, as there is benefit to being near another individual who wants to avoid the same predators as you. If they show alarm, Boyd states, it signals the presence of danger. Humans evolved a similar preference and dislike being excluded from groups. Yet, he notes, an inclination towards sociality with others can be challenged by competition for resources. He asks how sociality can evolve past a mere inclination towards group living into more robust forms of altruism.
>
> The answer, Boyd states, is active cooperation, in which individuals help others who share their genes, increasing the chance that those genes will spread throughout the population. One obvious example is parents who care for their genetic children, a behavior that is clearly fitness-enhancing. Hamilton, Boyd notes, generalized the principle of altruism towards genetic relatives under the phrase "inclusive fitness", also known as "kin selection". Scientists have observed hundreds of species that are altruistic towards genetic relatives, or, stated differently, act selfishly from a gene's eye view to protect other individuals who share their genes. This behavior is thus not a counterexample to evolutionary theory, on Boyd's view, but a confirmation of it.

### Things to note about this explanation

- Unlike the original, it begins with a clear statement of the source's main claim.
- It skips some sentences and expands on others.
- It doesn't have the same number of paragraphs as the source, but is in basically the same order (although that's not required and isn't always a good idea)
- Attribution is important, but you don't need to mention the source in every single sentence. The standard to meet is: will the reader be clear about whether a claim originated from a source vs the writer?
- You can refer to the source with pronouns, but treat each paragraph as a new start and make sure you use the source's name before reverting to the pronoun again. I'll explain this principle again in a later class.

This example is not a "correct" summary (there is no such thing), but it might be effective for some purposes.

Suggestion: compare this example to your submission and to the original text! Think about what writing choices you made and why.
