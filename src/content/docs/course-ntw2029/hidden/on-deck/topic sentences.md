- Topic sentences should directly state the main idea of the paragraph.
- Topic sentences should be at the beginning of each body paragraph unless you have a good reason to place them elsewhere.
- Topic sentences are usually just one sentence long, but sometimes two sentences are necessary.
- Topic sentence scope: The topic sentence must be broad enough to include the full main idea of the paragraph. It should not be a claim that is just the first step leading to the main idea.
- In an argumentative essay, each topic sentence states an argument or reason. Across the paper, the topic sentences should include all of the reasons needed to support the essay's thesis statement.
- Topic sentences are usually combined with transitions. They might begin with a transition word or phrase helping the reader understand how the previous paragraph relates to the current paragraph.
	- e.g. 1
		- > While Rolls' theory about the origins of aesthetics fills gaps left by previous views, it is flawed because is falsely assumes that that simple solutions hold an evolutionary advantage.
		- Here, the beginning of the sentence summarizes the previous paragraph, and the rest connects the previous idea to the main idea that will be shown in the current paragraph.
