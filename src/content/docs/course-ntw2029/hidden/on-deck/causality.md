- "Pinker explains that we feel annoyed when we see blurred images, because our senses detect that our eye lenses were not fully adjusted to give us clear images."

- "Pinker claims the human mind evolved a preference for fitness-enhancing environments as elements in such environments stimulate the brainâ€™s pleasure circuit s (Pinker, 1999, 524)."
	- We didn't evolve the preference to feel pleasure, but vice-versa

	- We don't love it because it is a byproduct, but because it mimics things we evolved to love, and we evolved to love them because they are fitness-enhancing.
