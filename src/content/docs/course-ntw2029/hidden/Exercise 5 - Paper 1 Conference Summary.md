# Exercise 5 - Paper 1 Conference Summary

## Purpose

This exercise helps you consolidate feedback from our conference and create an action plan for revising your draft. By articulating the key points from our discussion, you'll better internalize the feedback and develop a clear revision strategy.

## Overview

You'll answer five questions about the conference feedback and your revision plans. Submit your responses directly in the Canvas text box on the day of your conference.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the following questions into a document, and type your answers below each question:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your draft?
2. What other points of feedback were discussed?
3. What are your planned next steps for revising your draft?
4. Are there any next steps that you don't currently know how to make progress on? Do you have questions about them or do you know what to do?
5. (optional) Do you have any other questions or comments?

## Guidelines

- After this conference, you can ask specific questions about particular parts of the paper via email or messaging as time allows (you can email up to a few sentences of your draft)
- Please don't email me more than a few sentences; I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts or respond to general questions such as "is this ok?" [Why can't I ask you if part of my paper is ok?](test)
- You may request additional meetings during the week and I'll accommodate if time allows (these weeks tend to be quite busy)

## Feedback

You'll receive completion credit for thoughtful responses. This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your revision process.
