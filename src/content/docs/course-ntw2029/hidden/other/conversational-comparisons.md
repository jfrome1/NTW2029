Avoid using conversational comparison phrases such as "similar to how…" or "like when…." These expressions feel natural in speech and their meaning is understandable, but they sound informal in academic writing and require extra mental work from the reader.

Why do they require more mental work?

"Similar" is an adjective, and "similar to" is an adjective phrase. Adjectives normally modify nouns, as in "The data on birds is similar to data about elephants." "Like" is a preposition and "like when" is a prepositional phrase, which normally introduces a noun or noun phrase, as in "The selection pressure is like an unseen force". By contrast, words such as "because," "although," and "just as" are subordinating conjunctions. Readers expect subordinating conjunctions to connect two full clauses.

When you use conversational comparison openers, you make an adjective or preposition try to compare entire actions or situations rather than nouns. The reader does not get the grammatical pattern they are expecting. For example, in the sentence "Similar to how fiction appeals to our fitness-improving preferences, imaginary worlds appeal to our exploratory preferences," the reader expects a noun to follow "similar," as in "similar ideas about fiction…." But no noun appears. Instead, the phrase is followed by a full clause, which adjectives are not designed to modify. To make sense of the comparison, the reader has to mentally reconstruct the sentence into something like "Fiction appeals to our fitness-improving preferences in a similar way that imaginary worlds appeal to our exploratory preferences." That reconstruction takes effort.

In contrast, in the sentence "Just as fiction appeals to our fitness-improving preferences, imaginary worlds appeal to our exploratory preferences," the reader immediately knows that "just as" will connect two full clauses, so they can understand the comparison on a single pass without backtracking.
