## Prompt:

i wrote "Since FI objects or environments gave off FI signals, he argues  that human senses evolved to detect the FI signals from them, which guided us to the FI objects or environments" and my prof wrote "lack of 2nd comma = misplaced modifier" what does that mean

## Response:

Your professor is saying that without a second comma, the sentence accidentally suggests the wrong thing is giving off the signals. Here's your sentence:

"Since FI objects or environments gave off FI signals, he argues that human senses evolved to detect the FI signals from them, which guided us to the FI objects or environments."

The phrase **"which guided us to the FI objects or environments"** seems to describe **"them"**—but without a second comma, it's unclear whether it's the **signals** or the **objects/environments** doing the guiding. This creates a _misplaced modifier_—a phrase that appears to modify the wrong noun because of sentence structure.

Adding a second comma helps clarify that **"which guided us..."** refers to the **signals**, not the **objects**:

**Corrected version:**
"Since FI objects or environments gave off FI signals, he argues that human senses evolved to detect the FI signals from them, **which** guided us to the FI objects or environments."

The second comma before "which" separates the non-restrictive clause ("which guided...") from the rest of the sentence, making the meaning clearer.

## Prompt:

no, prob said that he wanted me to write "signals, he argues, that"

## Response:

Ah, got it. Your professor wants this structure:

**"Since FI objects or environments gave off FI signals, he argues, that human senses evolved..."**

The issue is with **"he argues that"** being placed immediately after "FI signals" without a comma set around it. Without the commas, it reads like "FI signals that human senses evolved..." which makes **"that human senses evolved..."** look like it's describing the **signals**, not part of what **he argues**.

So by adding the second comma — **"signals, he argues, that..."** — you’re clearly bracketing off the parenthetical **"he argues"**, making the main sentence structure easier to follow:

**"Since FI objects or environments gave off FI signals, he argues, that human senses evolved to detect..."**

That fixes the misplaced modifier.

## Prompt:

ok, this is the prof. what I mean is that without the 2nd comma after 'he argues' the sentence seems to claim that the reason he argues is that FI objects gave off FI signals, which is not what the sentence intends to say. Am I wrong in this? what should I have put in the comment?

## Response:

You're not wrong at all—you're pointing to a subtle but real syntactic ambiguity.

Without the second comma, the sentence reads:

**"Since FI objects or environments gave off FI signals, he argues that human senses evolved..."**

This makes **"he argues that..."** look like the _main clause_, and **"Since FI objects..."** like a subordinate clause giving the reason _why he argues_—which isn’t your student's intended meaning.

By inserting a second comma—**"signals, he argues, that human senses evolved..."**—you signal that **"he argues"** is a parenthetical, and the whole clause **"that human senses evolved..."** is the object of **"he argues"**, not a continuation of the reason clause.

In the margin comment, you might say something like:

_"Without the second comma after 'he argues,' the sentence can be misread as saying that the reason he argues is that FI objects give off signals. Adding the second comma clarifies that 'he argues' is parenthetical, and the whole clause 'that human senses evolved...' is what he argues."_

That explains the problem without overstating it.

## Prompt:

is there a standard name for this type of error?

## Response:

Yes, this is a type of **misleading or ambiguous syntax**, and more specifically, it can be described as a case of a **misleading subordinate clause** or **ambiguous sentence structure due to missing parenthetical commas**.

It also falls under the broader category of **misplaced modifiers**, though in this case it's not a classic modifier error—it's more about the _misleading attachment_ of clauses. In grammar terms, you could also describe it as a **misparsed adverbial clause**, where the reader may mistakenly attach the "since..." clause to "he argues" rather than to the larger claim.

If you want a precise label in your feedback, you could say:

**"Ambiguity caused by missing parenthetical commas, which misleads the reader about the logical relationship between clauses."**

## Prompt:

what is a "dangling modifier"?

## Response:

A **dangling modifier** is a descriptive phrase that doesn't clearly or logically attach to the word it's supposed to modify—usually because that word isn't actually in the sentence.

Example:

**"Walking through the park, the trees were beautiful."**

Here, _"Walking through the park"_ is meant to describe a person, but the sentence makes it look like the _trees_ were doing the walking. The modifier "dangling" at the start has nothing to attach to.

Corrected:

**"Walking through the park, I saw that the trees were beautiful."**

Now the modifier clearly refers to _"I."_

So: a dangling modifier introduces information, but the sentence doesn’t provide a subject for it to logically modify.

## Prompt:

is the student's example a dangling modifier or not? why?

## Response:

The student's sentence is **not** a dangling modifier.

A **dangling modifier** happens when the subject the modifier is supposed to describe is missing or unclear. In the student's sentence:

**"Since FI objects or environments gave off FI signals, he argues that human senses evolved to detect the FI signals from them, which guided us to the FI objects or environments."**

There _is_ a clear subject ("he") and the modifier ("Since FI objects...") _does_ have something to attach to—it’s just that the sentence structure creates ambiguity about what is being modified or explained.

So the issue isn’t that the modifier is “dangling”—it’s that without a second comma, the sentence creates an **ambiguous attachment**. The reader might misinterpret the "since..." clause as explaining _why he argues_, when it's actually setting up the content of what he argues.

In short: it’s a **misleading or ambiguous clause attachment**, not a dangling modifier.

## Prompt:

write an explanation of this error, which I see often, that I can put on my website so students can understand the problem. Include examples.

## Response:

Sure! Here's a concise explanation you could post on your website:

**Misleading Clause Attachments: When Missing Commas Confuse the Reader**

Sometimes, sentences are structured in a way that unintentionally misleads the reader about _what goes with what_. This often happens when a phrase like _"he argues that..."_ is placed right after a subordinate clause, without commas to clarify the sentence structure.

**Example of the problem:**

_"Since these environments gave off signals, he argues that humans evolved to detect them."_

This sentence can be read two ways:

1. **Intended meaning:** He argues _that humans evolved to detect the signals_ (and the “since” clause explains the claim).

2. **Misleading meaning:** He argues _because these environments gave off signals_ (making the “since” clause explain _why_ he argues).

The reader might think the “since” clause explains his motivation for arguing, rather than setting up the content of his claim.

**How to fix it:**

Add commas around "he argues" to show that it’s a parenthetical phrase—not the main clause:

**Corrected:**
_"Since these environments gave off signals, he argues, that humans evolved to detect them."_

Now it's clear: the “since” clause sets up the reasoning behind the _claim_, not the reason for the _arguing_.

**Another example:**

**Unclear:**
_"Because the data were inconclusive, she claims the study should be redone."_

**Clear:**
_"Because the data were inconclusive, she claims, the study should be redone."_

Adding the second comma avoids misleading the reader into thinking the data explain _why she claims something_, rather than _what she is claiming_.

**Takeaway:**
When you use a reporting phrase like _"she claims"_, _"he argues"_, or _"they suggest"_, and it's not the main point of the sentence, consider setting it off with commas. It helps the reader follow your meaning without stumbling.

Let me know if you'd like it in a more casual or more technical tone.

## Prompt:

use fewer grammatical terms, since my students don't usually know what they mean

## Response:

Got it—here's a version with simpler language and fewer grammatical terms:

**When a Missing Comma Changes the Meaning**

Sometimes, just one missing comma can confuse your reader about what you’re really saying. This often happens when you include a phrase like “he argues” or “she claims” in the middle of a sentence.

**Example of the problem:**

_"Since these environments gave off signals, he argues that humans evolved to detect them."_

This can be read two ways:

1. He argues _that humans evolved to detect the signals_.

2. He argues _because the environments gave off signals_ (which isn’t what the writer meant).

**What’s going wrong?**
Without a second comma after "he argues," it sounds like the sentence is explaining _why_ he argues. But what the writer meant was _what_ he argues.

**How to fix it:**
Add a second comma to separate the “he argues” part:

**Clear version:**
_"Since these environments gave off signals, he argues, that humans evolved to detect them."_

Now it’s clear that "he argues" is just something being said along the way, and the real point is what he’s arguing.

**Another example:**

**Unclear:**
_"Because the data were inconclusive, she claims the study should be redone."_
(This could sound like the data are the reason she’s making the claim.)

**Clear:**
_"Because the data were inconclusive, she claims, the study should be redone."_
(Now it’s clear the sentence is about what she claims.)

**The bottom line:**
When you include a short phrase like “he says,” “she argues,” or “they believe” in the middle of a sentence, add a comma before and after it. It helps your reader follow what you mean without getting lost.
