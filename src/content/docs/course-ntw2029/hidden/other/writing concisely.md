writing concisely
	concision is not about moving through your reasoning quickly, skipping steps in your explanation, or eliminating nuance
	concision is about avoiding these errors:
		including unnecessary content
			e.g. content not needed to demonstrate your thesis, sometimes included because it is interesting or represents effort invested
		including redundant sentences and phrases
			redundant phrases can happen when using a bureaucratic style or a conversational style
				e.g., "due to the fact that" instead of "because"
				e.g., "absolutely essential" instead of "essential"
				e.g., "general consensus" instead of "consensus"
			redundant phrases are rarely due to correcting for unclear pronoun use
			redundant sentences occur when students focus too much on individual sentences or paragraphs and lose sight of the larger structures
			redundancy is often eliminated in the process of restructuring sentences to improve flow (X does Y and Old then New)
		using filler language, padding, empty phrases
			these are words that add little content to the paper, such as "in his writing", "we should also note that", and "is it important to mention"
			more examples
				> I concede that it may seem that way; however, a problem I have with it is that...
				> I contend that his lack of specific scientific evidence threatens the cogency of his stand.
				> Additionally, we need to understand why Boyd argues that...


	Reader-Centered Benefits
Increased Clarity: Concise writing makes complex ideas easier to understand. When unnecessary words are eliminated, main points stand out more clearly, helping readers grasp arguments more quickly and accurately.
Improved Engagement: Academic readers have limited time and attention. Concise writing leads to better engagement because readers are:

More likely to read the entire paper instead of skimming
Better able to remember key points
Less likely to get lost in wordiness

Greater Persuasiveness: Concise writing appears more authoritative and confident. Compare:

"It could perhaps be suggested that the evidence might possibly indicate..."
"The evidence indicates..."

Writer-Centered Benefits
Intellectual Discipline: Writing concisely forces you to:

Think more precisely about your claims
Identify and prioritize your strongest arguments
Recognize when you don't fully understand a concept (often revealed when you can't explain it concisely)

Better Grades and Feedback: When writing concisely:

Instructors can more easily evaluate your arguments
You're more likely to stay within assigned word limits
You demonstrate mastery of academic communication standards

Enhanced Revision Skills: Learning to write concisely develops editing skills that transfer to all forms of communication, teaching you to recognize patterns of wordiness and make deliberate language choices.
