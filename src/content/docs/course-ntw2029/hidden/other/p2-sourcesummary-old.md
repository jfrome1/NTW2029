For this assignment, do your best to provide a summary of your main source in outline form, following the detailed instructions below.f your source has sections or other internal structure, I suggest you use that structure as a starting point for your summary. Try to limit your summary to 1 printed page (single-spaced) to make sure you are not going into too much detail. Submit this assignment as an attached file.

Put the citation for your source at the top as your title. Follow it with the paper's main thesis. Then, put your outline at the end.

If you are discussing a humanities or theoretical paper, do not use section headings as your main points.

If you are discussing an empirical research paper, you may put the main section headings before your main points, which will be complete sentences (e.g. "3. Method: the experiment asked subjects to watch a film and comment on their thoughts during viewing."). The outline should retain the original order of the main sections of the paper (e.g., intro, lit review, methods-whatever the main sections are). One note: sometimes empirical papers start with an introduction but don't label it with a heading. In this case, in your outline, add "Introduction: " to your the first main point to make things clearer.

Do not focus on being comprehensive (i.e., including every argument in the source or making sure every paragraph is represented in the outline). There might be paragraphs or arguments in the source that are not really relevant to the source thesis, and you should not include these in your outline. Instead, focus on capturing the main points of the argument. To identify those main points and differentiate them from other parts of the source, you should try to understand the argumentative structure of the source. Ask yourself questions such as:

- What is the academic conversation this source is contributing to?
- What is the main question the source aims to answer?
- What new ideas does the source claim it is adding to the conversation?
- What is the main thesis of the source?
- What are the main points supporting that thesis?
- What kind of examples or evidence does the source use, and what function do they serve?
- What does the source seem to care most about? What is motivating them to write this essay?
- Who is the source arguing against?

IMPORTANT: don't answer the above questions in your assignment. Their purpose is to help you identify the overall structure of the source argument, which will help you better identify the main claims that you will summarize in your outline. The outline should summarize the source's main claims in complete sentences in a hierarchy that reflects the argumentative structure.

KEY TERMS: Look for any central concepts in your source argument and the key terms used to reflect them. If your outline uses these key terms, you may want to have a definition of one or more of these terms as a subpoint in your outline.

This assignment isn't easy, but don't stress about getting it perfect. I am forcing you to start now so we have more time later to draft and revise the paper.

Assignment purpose:

- To Paper 2 requires you to analyze a source argument, and the first step is understanding the argument, which this assignment will help you do.

Logistics:

- You must understand your source Before explaining someone else's argument, you must understand it. A reverse outline can help you consolidate your notes on a source in a way that allows you to better understand the argument's claims.

- Overview
  - Write a précis of your source, which is shorter version of the argument that clearly conveys the main points and claims
  - Submit the précis as a Word document (.docx).
  - The précis should be about 300-350 words. If it is less than 150, or more than 450, you may have misunderstood the assignment.
  - Your précis should be in a hierarchical outline form, and every outline point must be exactly one complete sentence. Details below.
  - The goal of the précis is to help you understand your source argument claims and structure. Doing this will help you identify areas you need to clarify about the source argument for further analysis. The outline will strictly follow the form described below. The form is designed to force you to put your understanding of the source claims into a concrete form so I can give you helpful feedback.
  - I have taken great pains to be VERY SPECIFIC about my expectations for this assignment so please follow them carefully.
- Recommended method for understanding the argument
  - Since you have now read your source and have a good general understanding of its argument, you now need to gain a detailed understanding of the argument that you can analyze. The following is my suggestion for how to take notes on the source to gain that understanding. This section describes a way to take notes, not how to write the final assignment you will submit.
  - Go through the paper and, for each paragraph, in your own words, write down a paraphrase of the main idea of that one paragraph. Paraphrase the main idea the reader is supposed to get from that paragraph. Often, this idea does not match any one particular sentence in the source.
  - Make sure your paraphrase captures the entire main idea of the paragraph. I do NOT mean that it captures all of the details; that would be impossible. I mean that the paraphrase should not restate just one idea that is in the paragraph; it must convey the entire main idea while ignoring details that the source uses to support the main idea.
  - VERY IMPORTANT: the paraphrase must be a complete sentence, not a topic or a sentence fragment, in order to force yourself to do the work needed to understand the paragraph
  - Sometimes the main idea will be quite specific, such as "This study assumes that volume of lacrimal production is an accurate proxy of sadness." Other times, the main idea might be fairly general, such as "There are many ways scholars have studied emotion" (this paragraph might list 10 different ways scholars have studied emotion, but those details are likely not important in paraphrasing the main idea)
  - Now, summarize at a higher level of abstraction: "chunk" the paper into pieces larger than one paragraph each by grouping 3-5 paraphrases together and summarizing them into one larger claim. I'm not saying you combine these statements into one long sentence that captures everything in all of them. I'm saying you need to think abstractly about the main point of this "chunk" of the paper and write that main point in your own words. Again, you will likely need to leave out some content that, at this level, is detail unnecessary to understanding the main idea of this 3-5 paragraph section. That detail is still probably quite important in the argument, of course, in supporting the main idea and convincing the reader that this idea is true; it is just not essential for understanding what the main idea is or what it claims.
  - Keep repeating this process until you have paraphrases of the paper's main ideas that include just 3-5 main points. The number of hierarchical "levels" you have will depend on your source, but probably no more three in most cases.
  - If your source has section headings,  you can use these to help you organize and group your paraphrased points. If not, you will have to figure out how to best group the paragraphs.
  - You should now have a clear idea of the source argument thesis, main points, and the subpoints (and sub-subpoints, etc.) that support the argument.
- Writing the assignment
  - State the source's thesis at the top (2 sentences maximum, but aim for 1).
  - Do not include source quotations. Use paraphrases only. Put the page number or range for each point at the end of that point. e.g. (22-23).
  - Put a properly APA-formatted reference list after the outline. It will include only one source for this assignment.
  - For this assignment, your points will be written in the voice of the source, so instead of "Boyd says that cooperation evolved..." you just write "Cooperation evolved...".
  - Follow the thesis with numbered/lettered lines in a hierarchical outline form. The exact number/letter scheme doesn't matter, but make sure each line has a unique indicator because I'll need to be able to easily refer to specific lines in the outline for my feedback. In this assignment, I'll call each numbered/lettered part of the outline a "point", but "point" refers to an indicator followed by sentence, not an idea in a general sense. (A point would be: "3a. Boyd claims that this experiment shows that cooperation is heritable.").
  - Each numbered point is called a "main point" and lettered points indented underneath main points are "subpoints", and "point" without an adjective refers to both. You will have 2 to 5 main points in the outline.
    - Avoid:
      - 1a. The appeal of Harlequin romance is universal, and is built on the historical and cross-cultural popularity of romance as a genre. (386-387)
      - 1b. Romance fiction is the most lucrative fiction category in the United States and is dominated by Harlequin Enterprises Limited, the largest publisher of romance novels internationally. (387)
      - 1c. Women make up 90% of the consumer base of romance fiction. (388)
      - Problem: there is no main point summarizing the three subpoints. An appropriate main point might be: (1) Harlequin romances are a popular series of romance fiction that appeals primarily to women.
  - Each point will paraphrase a claim from the source argument.
  - Each point in the précis should contain EXACTLY one complete sentence--not two or more sentences. Do not use more than one sentence per point in any circumstance.
    - Correct:
      - 1. Dance movements convey sex-specific information indicating an individual's biological quality (352).
        - A. Male physical strength may be a mating-related quality conveyed through dance as more elaborate dance movements are challenging and require a higher level of coordination to be executed (352-353).
        - B. In contrast, female dance movements may provide information about their fertility (353).
  - Each point should be a COMPLETE sentence with a clear subject and verb, ending in a period—not a phrase or sentence fragment.
    - Avoid: "Adaptive traits from the EEA" [not a sentence]
    - Avoid: "What happens in modern society." [not a sentence]
    - Avoid:
      - 1. Action films and video games teach coping by:
        - a) Balancing negative and positive experiences and creating a hierarchy among them.
        - b) Integrating negative emotions into positive goals to pose activating challenges.
      - Problem: (1) is not a complete sentence by itself. (A) and (B) are not complete sentences by themselves. The incorrect format encourages the student to make a list of points without really summarizing them into increasingly broad ideas.
  - The subject of your point sentences should NOT be the source author, but a thing the author talks about (an idea or another author). This is very important! If you don't follow this rule you will likely end up describing the source as a piece of writing rather than actually summarizing its argument.
    - Avoid:
      - 1. The authors of this study assume that musicality is universal in human vocal communication.
        - a. To overcome the cultural variation in music, the authors focus on the universality of musicality since it's a product of our brain's physiology and psychology. (2)
      - Problem: both points describe the assumptions or actions of the authors. Possible correction: (1) Musicality is universal in human vocal communication, (a) Despite the cultural variation in music, the universality of music can be explained because music is a product of humans' evolved brains.
  - Avoid using "this" or "it" as the subject of the points
    - Avoid: "This is an example of mate selection." [What is an example of mate selection? Identify it clearly.]
  - Each point should be a STATEMENT—not a question.
    - Avoid: "What does survival have to do with sexual selection?" [not a statement]
  - Each point should make a claim about your TOPIC, it should NOT make a claim about what the source does in the paper. Yes, I am repeating this same point with additional examples because this guideline is so important.
    - Avoid: "Boyd gives several supporting examples."
    - Correct: "One modern mechanism for punishing cheaters is a police force." (stating the example)
    - Avoid: "Pinker gives several reasons that music is pleasurable."
    - Correct: "Music includes sounds similar to those found in the EEA" (written as if you are Pinker making this argument)
  - Do NOT include MORE than 3 subpoints per main point. If you have 4 or more subpoints, you are likely listing a number of related claims in the order the author makes them rather than actually summarizing ideas into larger and larger units.
  - Do not include lines about the paper introduction or conclusion in the outline. The thesis stated above the outline will serve as the introduction to the outline.
  - I would provide an example student précis but this is the first time I have assigned one for this course in this way. If you have questions, post on the discussion board or email me.
- Additional instructions for empirical scientific research papers
  - Science papers do not put their conclusions in the beginning as a thesis. They put hypotheses in the beginning and then tell you whether they think they proved their hypotheses in the Discussion and Conclusion sections.
