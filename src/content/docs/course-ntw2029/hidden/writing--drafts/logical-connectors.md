- Words that indicate logical relationships between ideas
	- contrasting ideas: however, although, but
		- these connect two ideas that are opposed. "[idea A]; however, [idea B]" means "Reader, given that I have told you idea A, you might think that idea B would not be the case, but in fact, it is the case". Readers will be confused if ideas A and B are not actually related in this way.
		- proper use:
			- > Evolutionary theory suggests that universal human activities are universal because they increased reproductive fitness in the EEA. However, art is universal despite the fact that it doesn't seem to increase reproductive fitness.
		- improper use:
			- > Evolutionary theory suggests that universal human activities are universal because they increased reproductive fitness in the EEA. However, Pinker gives three reasons that music might be enjoyable.
		- improper use (actual student example):
			> Gervais & Wilson (2005) uses evolutionary psychology to explain the phenomenon of human laughing. They use the term "laughter" broadly and do not specify any scenarios. However, consumption of comedic art-forms is pervasive and entrenched in modern society.
            > Pinker argues that our minds evolved during a specific environment humans lived in, known as the environment of evolutionary adaptation (EEA),  which was a set of specific conditions that described the period when most of our ancestors lived that humans are best adapted to. However , Pinker clarifies that while the mind is a product of natural selection, not everything the mind does improves reproductive fitness, including enjoying art.
	- dependent ideas: therefore, hence, since, because
		- these connect ideas where one idea is true because the other is true. "[idea A]; hence/therefore/because, [idea B]" means "Reader, idea B is true because idea A is true, and belief in idea B depends on belife in idea A." Readers will be confused if ideas A and B are not actually related in this way.
		- improper use (student e.g.)
            - > Pinker clarifies that while the mind is a product of natural selection, not everything the mind does improves reproductive fitness, including enjoying art.. Thus, Pinker claims that enjoying art is a byproduct of natural selection, meaning an unintended consequence of adaptations of the mind, specifically parts of the brain that signal pleasure when in fitness enhancing environments, and the part of the brain that identifies causal relationships, through his argument that art stimulates pleasure by mimicking environments and actions that improved fitness during the EEA.
