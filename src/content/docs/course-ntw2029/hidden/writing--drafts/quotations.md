- quotation: why and how much?
	- why quote?
		- it can add credibility to your summary
		- if you plan to discuss the source's exact wording
		- academic honesty if you would like to use the same words
		- the quote is so well-written that a summary would weaken its point
 - how much to quote?
	- quote the minimum needed to serve your purpose; young scholars usually overquote
	- include quotations not to show that you've read the author's work but just when needed to support your own argument
	- how to quote?
	- quote accurately: check your transcription against the original
	- in your framing and explanations, use language that accurately and fairly reflects the spirit of the quoted passage
		- as with summaries, misleading quotations will hurt your credibility more than it can help your argument
	- short quotations should go in quotation marks—" "—long quotations that go 4 lines or more (which you should generally try to avoid) should be indented as block quotes
	- use ellipses (...) to indicate the omission of any words, but never remove words in a way that changes the meaning of the passage or misleads your reader
	- use square [ ] brackets to indicate your additions to quotations
		- e.g. replacing a pronoun with a name or changing a word to make the quotation read grammatically in your sentence
- framing your quotations
	- the quotation sandwich:
		- statement introducing the quotation
		- the quotation itself, accompanied by a citation
		- explanation of what the quotation says and how it supports your argument
	- templates: Birkenstein and Graf pp. 296-7 (discussed on pp. 42-55)
	- Quotations do not speak for themselves! Quotations are words that have been taken from their original texts and that need to be integrated into their new context. Quotations that are not framed in this way are sometimes called "dangling quotations".
- when you tell the reader what a source says, you can do so in three ways:
	- paraphrasing the source (conveying their idea in your own words)
	- quoting the source at length (using their exact words in explaining the idea)
	- combining the two (primarily paraphrasing but quoting specific words or short phrases)
	- note that whichever way you choose, you must cite the source to avoid plagiarism—citation is required whether or not you quote the source's exact words
- good reasons to quote rather than paraphrase
	- showing the source's exact words can add credibility to your summary by showing that it is accurate
	- you need to show the source's exact wording so you can discuss it (e.g., if you think the source's argument is ambiguous, you might need to show that their words can be potentially understood in different ways)
	- the quote is so well-written that a summary would weaken its point
	- you would like to use the same words in an academically honest way
- bad but common reasons students quote rather than paraphrase
	- you are unsure about the exact meaning of a sentence in the reading, but you need to mention the idea as part of your discussion (instead, ask for help in understanding the meaning well enough that you can confidently summarize in your own words)
	- you want to demonstrate that you read the source carefully (usually, unnecessary quoting has the opposite effect, making it seem that your writing was rushed rather than careful)
- how much to quote?
	- quote the minimum needed to serve your writing purpose (see good reasons to quote above)
	- young scholars usually overquote
	- realize that relevance can change as you write and revise your paper
		- don't keep a quote in your paper just because it is already there, as you revise, check and ask yourself if it is still serving a purpose
- how to use quotes effectively?
	- quote accurately
		- wording: double-check your transcription against the original to make sure the wording, capitalization, and punctuation are exactly the same in the source and your paper
			- if you need to make changes or additions to the quote, put them in square [ ] brackets
			- e.g. you may need to replacing a pronoun with a name or change a word to make the quotation read grammatically in your sentence, or you may want to remove a long introductory clause in a quote that is not relevant to your point
		- context: make sure that the quotation accurately and fairly reflects the spirit of the quoted passage, including its surrounding context in the original source
		- misquoting is devastating for your credibility!
	- frame every quotation
		1. start with a statement that sets up quotation and identifies the speaker
			- when introducing quotes, it can be useful to choose action verbs that signal things to the reader about the source author's intent; rather than "they say" or "they believe", you could say that they urge, emphasize, complain, protest, misrepresent, etc.
		2. provide the quotation itself, accompanied by a citation
		3. explain the quote's meaning and importance (i.e. what you want the reader to gain from the quote)
			- the most common problem students have with quotes is assuming that quotes speak for themselves—they don't!
			- quotations are words that have been taken from their original texts and they need to be integrated into their new context
			- better to overexplain quotes than to underexplain them
		- see templates for introducing and explaining quotations in _TSIS_ pp. 296-7 (discussed on pp. 42-55)
- formatting quotes
	- short quotations should go in quotation marks—" "— and long quotations that are 4 lines or more should be indented as block quotes (but you should generally try to avoid long quotations)
	- use ellipses (...) to indicate the omission of any words, but never remove words in a way that changes the meaning of the passage or misleads your reader

Good example of using quotes:

> Boyd claims that humans evolved to have an innate sense of fairness that inclines us to punish cheaters. In describing this inclination, Boyd argues that "our emotions...alert us to register unfairness" and "motivate us to punish it" (61). His point is that if people register the situation or outcome to be unfair, they may become angry and upset, which then drives them to act on those emotions.

> Pinker claims that the human mind "registers the attainment of increments of fitness by giving us a sensation of pleasure" (524), implying that the ability to experience pleasure evolved as a reinforcement mechanism to encourage humans to reliably repeat fitness-enhancing behaviors.
