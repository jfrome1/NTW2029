Please review the [Paper 1 assignment](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p1-1-overview) and all [paper guidelines](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/paper-guidelines) carefully before submitting. I also suggest reviewing the writing topics covered covered in class and on the website as you revise your paper.

Make sure to [remove any draft formatting and comments](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/feedback/#removing-my-feedback-for-revision) from your final paper before submitting.
