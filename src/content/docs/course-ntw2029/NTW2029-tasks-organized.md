# NTW2029 Tasks (Organized)

## Priority 1: High-Impact, Medium-Difficulty (Tackle First)

### P08 Revisions

- provide guideline for total number of paragraphs; some students have tons of tiny paragraphs so their outlines are 25+ topic sentences long
- give formatting guidance for topic sentences, e.g. numbered list
- tell students to put thesis at the top of the outline
- for outline, if the first sentence is a short sentence that doesn't capture main idea, students should either reword or also include the sentence following it.
- thesis should name and explain the explicit disagreement/criticism, not just identify the underlying issues (the lack of this may explain why student's theses are coming late in many drafts; they're trying to explain the explicit disagreement in detail in the intro)
- many student outlines show topic sentences that are just descriptive, which is not ideal; need to figure out how to teach about this, maybe it should be part of the lesson on wordiness/condensing prose
- consider adding: student reflection on draft about what questions they have, what they think needs work, etc.

#### P08 Revision Workflow

**Data Sources:**
- Submissions: `G:\Dropbox (Personal)\JD\90-99 teaching courses\93 current courses\2510 NTW Evolution\submitted assignments\p2-p08-full-draft-and-outline\markdown`
- Margin comments: `G:\Dropbox (Personal)\JD\90-99 teaching courses\93 current courses\2510 NTW Evolution\submitted assignments\p2-p08-full-draft-and-outline\JF comments`
- Audio feedback (.vtt): `G:\Dropbox (Personal)\JD\90-99 teaching courses\93 current courses\2510 NTW Evolution\recordings\2510 P08 feedback`
- Conference transcripts: `G:\Dropbox (Personal)\JD\90-99 teaching courses\93 current courses\2510 NTW Evolution\recordings\2510 P08 conference`
- P09 grades (quality proxy): `G:\Dropbox (Personal)\JD\90-99 teaching courses\93 current courses\2510 NTW Evolution\grades\2510 grades.xlsx`

**Phase 1: Quality Stratification**
1. Load P09 final grades from grades spreadsheet
2. Identify high/mid/low grade students
3. Sample 2 submissions from each tier (6 total) for analysis

**Phase 2: Pattern Identification**
1. For each sampled submission, extract:
   - Paragraph count
   - Outline formatting used
   - Thesis placement in outline
   - Topic sentence examples (descriptive vs. analytical)
2. Review corresponding margin comments for repeated issues
3. Review audio feedback for how problems were explained verbally
4. Review conference transcripts for student questions and fix explanations

**Phase 3: Calibration Questions**
Present patterns to instructor for calibration:
- "Is [student X]'s outline the right length, too long, or too short?"
- "Does this topic sentence count as analytical enough?"
- "Should this thesis go at top of outline or is current placement acceptable?"

**Phase 4: Draft Revisions**
With calibrated understanding, draft specific additions to P08 assignment.

#### Phase 1 Results: Quality Stratification (Completed 2025-01-03)

**P09 Grade Tiers:**

| Tier | Grade Range | Count | Students |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| High | A/A- (78+) | 9 | Shannon (84), Yuning (82), Krishna (81), Jia Qi (81), Aanya (79), Xin Jie (79), Danelle (78), Ashley (78), Lauren (78) |
| Mid | B+ (70-77) | 13 | An Xiao (77), Reiner (76), Tony (75), Zhao Wu (74), Abhishek (73), Zi Yong (73), Soham (72), Minh (72), Jia Yang (71), Colby (71), Ki-En (71), Ziduan (70), Jordan (70) |
| Low | B or below (<70) | 2 | Portia (68), Yi Fan (50)* |

*Yi Fan excluded from sample due to documented compliance issues (late submissions, missed highlighting requirements) and missing P08 submission.

**Selected Sample (5 students):**

| Tier | Student | P09 | P08 File |
|------|---------|-----|----------|
| High | Shannon Lam Shan Ning | A (84) | shannonlamshanning_132174_7940828_P08 Full Draft.md |
| High | Aanya Agarwal | A- (79) | aanyaagarwal_271281_7934565_Aanya Agarwal E1 Paper 2 Draft.md |
| Mid | An Xiao | A- (77) | anxiao_189051_7946605_NTW2029 An Xiao P08.md |
| Mid | Jordan Khong Jun Wei | B+ (70) | jordankhongjunwei_249544_7947376_P08 - Full Draft + Outline-2.md |
| Low | Portia Tan Hui Man | B (68) | portiatanhuiman_LATE_257343_7948913_NTW2029 P08-1.md |

**Rationale for sample:**
- Shannon: Top performer, establishes upper bound
- Aanya: High tier at different score point
- An Xiao: Top of mid range (77 vs 70-76)
- Jordan: Bottom of mid range; also noted in original tasks as example of descriptive topic sentences
- Portia: Only "normal" low-tier student (Yi Fan's issues are compliance, not necessarily writing)

**Next: Phase 2 — Analyze submissions for paragraph count, outline formatting, thesis placement, topic sentence quality**

### P06 Revisions

- does it say to keep paragraphs separate? maybe an old version didn't?
- revise to require more quotationQ5 make mandatory to check
- many students wrote Q1 answer like the intro to a final paper, should clarify
- revise to ask students in this assignment to always quote in full sentences
- target argument, revise to specifcy elements: phenomenon to be explained, basic argument, claimed scope of theory, claimed contribution of theory
- move from Guidelines to Requirements: "Use the five numbered requirement headings as section headers in your submission. This structured format ensures you address each requirement and makes it easier to provide targeted feedback in your conference."
- clarify that early in the analysis, students should use long quotes to provide fuller context, since it's too early to evaluate what's important

### Thesis Structure Clarification

- p2 final thesis should start with 'authors disagree about X, [describe 2 contrasting positions]', not start with 'the authors disagree because...'

### New Content Pages

- add page on using quotes, how/when, with examples

---

## Priority 2: High-Impact, High-Difficulty (Strategic Investments)

### AI/Process Development

- define AI process for analyzing assignments/submissions

### E12 Analysis

- analyze e12 for many possible uses, e.g. compile advice to future students to hand out

### P2 Overview Restructuring

- define target audience as someone familiar with EP generally, but not specific arguments
- both significance and explanation have two levels, and that may need to be communicated to students
    - significance: significance of commentary criticism and significance of student thesis claim
    - explanation: explanation of target's and commentary's individual arguments and explanation of their disagreement

---

## Priority 3: Quick Wins (Medium-Impact, Low-Difficulty)

- make sure e06 and other similar assignments have GenAI statement
- clarify highlighting only in body paragraphs
- clarify that don't do topic sentence highlighting for introductions
- must confirm GenAI content claims with sources and cite them

---

## Assignment-Specific Tasks

### P1

- clarify that students shouldn't talk about status or high art/low art at all--not just that they shouldn't focus on it
- consider possibility of giving example of proper analysis of general argument and having students explain/analyze just 1-2 specific arguments about specific art forms?
- or, more like an Amherst paper, where I give a directive prompt about a topic they should discuss?

### P07

- check for reference list requirement

### E06

- analyze e06 to find out student's main existing concerns or areas they felt unprepared for in writing p1
- add expected word count or similar to e06 to ensure students don't dash it off (maybe just remind its importance for Writing Development)
- fix e06 for 2520
    - remove reference to "feedback form"
    - Q3 - limit to 2-3 changes

---

## Course Infrastructure

### Schedule/Timeline

- make sure that every student gets a weekend between the conference and the due date for p2 final (p09) next time
- fix Freeplane to match schedule.md so I can make changes in FP and then post the revised schedule
- add to schedule when to bring devices in 2nd half of class

### Canvas

- add brief checklist to Canvas assignment pages with main header info/assignment requirements only, see if I can make agreement checkbox has irequired
- change assignment categories to exercises, paper prep, drafts and final
- on Canvas assignment pages, put checklist of intro/header info, GenAI and word count, highlighting
- Canvas exercise grading is complete/incomplete/excused, which doesn't capture my grading policy of 1/0.5/0. I need to figure out how to capture the points, and maybe I don't do it on Canvas, but in Excel.

### Conference Sign-ups

- fix conference sign ups
    - MS Booking doesn't seem to allow me to launch the Zoom conference, so abandon it if it's not possible
    - don't allow students to sign up for Fri on the first day of conferences, because no one signs up for the first day until all other slots are taken, and the laggards don't even see the message in time to sign up for the first day

### Student Tracking

- create online spreadsheet with student target articles, commentary articles, theses, etc.

---

## Teaching/Pedagogy

### Writing Guidance

- guidance on 'don't mindread' - good to imagine motivations for analysis, but write with reference to text and its effects only
- condense wording on grammar and style page
- add something about condensing author names to acronyms or initials, e.g. Weisberg and Friend to W&F (must make decision about whether students can do this)
- in introductions, tell students to not refer to the "academic conversation" explicitly
- currently no guidance for writing essay titles, maybe make titles optional?
- see if there's a way to cover transitions, at least in a basic way, before p1
- student refered to writing center telling them "They also told me that I could use argument dissection and argument mapping to check how much I actually need to explain on a certain point." - find out more

### Peer Review

- peer review
    - tell students in advance: don't expect your peers to be experts that can check your understanding of the articles; that's too much to ask because they haven't analyzed the articles
    - instead, they will act as first-time readers to tell you what's confusing

### Class Participation

- class participation - add survey of classmates in group work

### Student Resources

- on day 1, show students quotes from last term's e12 to show achievement of course goals
- create summary sheets to hand out monthly about topics covered, advice given, etc. to reinforce to students how much they have learned in the course so far
- add page 'how to email your source professionally' (see Portia's email to me )

### Examples/Models

- use Jordan's P08 as an example of descriptive/vague topic sentences and claims that students should avoid; other students with descriptive topic sentences include Krishna, but should check P08 feedback transcripts for more

---

## Lecture/Content

### Specific Lectures

- clarify how to highlight topic sentences - not before thesis presented
- maybe review 'one gene' issue for lecture based on Beekman's _The Origins of Language_ (2025); on the "You Are Not so Smart" podcast from 2025-11-10 she said brain size was hugely affected by whether we had 2, 3, or 5 copies of one particular gene; note however that this is a physical trait and not a behavioral one, but it's about brain size so it probably affects both
- fix 9.1 lecture notes, questions are in different places for different topics, and there is redundancy
- fix 8.1 handout question 4, byproduct arguments = arguments against byproduct theory
- clarify reason for discussing puzzling vs. non-puzzling claims; it's for understanding what our evidence standards should be for different sorts of claims (7.1)
- 7.2 - more structured questions, without doing the work for them of analyzing things, maybe more questions about what 'they' say, or more guiding questions about how the entertainment vs information distinction relates to the imaginary worlds hypothesis, or about what they claim about factors that influence variability in interest in imaginary world fiction
- clarify how the research frameworks introduced in 7.1 relate to p2
- add Austin discussion questions
- add better Goldfinch conclusion discussion questions
- fix notes on Goldfinch conclusions, I misread the moderate skeptic and told students the wrong thing

### Unfalsifiable Claims Examples

- unfalsifiable claims
    -Yes, and I'll add these when I revise my course materials. Some examples:
        - wearing this magnetic bracelet will increase your vitality and energy
        - my deceased grandmother sends me messages in my dreams
        - in a former life, I was Ramtha, a powerful warrior - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Z._Knight
        - Some EP examples:
        - men like the color blue because in the EEA it was advantageous to live near water
        - mental disorders are byproducts of evolved adaptations
        - Often, you can imagine a testable version of an unfalsifiable claim where the claim is much more specific and is about the present day rather than the past.

## Technical/Website

- for anchor links, check if hyphens are fine in the anchor target title or not; it will be easier if they are; if so, update AI instruction docs
- fix schedule and exercises to change 'conference summary' to 'conference report'

---

## Under Consideration (No Decision Yet)

- consider longer word count for p2, or wider range?
