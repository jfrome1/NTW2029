title: Conference guidelines

I'll have at least three individual conferences with each student this semester. Conferences can be in-person (the default) or via Zoom (at your request); either is fine with me. I [:record conferences](#x-recordconferences) and I'll [:share the recording and transcript](#x-sharetherecording) with you afterwards.

## Bookings

I use Microsoft Bookings to schedule conferences. Check the conference sign-up time carefully, as my Bookings page uses 24-hour time. If you see only strange times (like middle of the night), [:check your settings.](#x-checkyoursettings).

## In-person conference logistics

Conferences are usually held in-person, in my office, Cinnamon West 02-09. When your conference time comes, knock on my door to let me know you've arrived and are ready to begin. Feel free to bring and use devices during the conference.

Please do not informally switch time slots with other students as I prepare for the conferences based on the schedule. If you want to switch time slots with another student via the Bookings app (canceling and re-booking new slots), that's fine as long as you do it at least one day in advance.

## Zoom conference logistics

If you prefer a Zoom conference, let me know after you've booked a time slot and at least one day in advance of the conference. Zoom conferences are at this link: <https://nus-sg.zoom.us/my/jonathanfrome> or Meeting ID: 250 394 5161. If you have difficulties joining the Zoom, email or message me to let me know what's going on.

Please follow these guidelines to avoid distractions during Zoom conferences:

- Find in a quiet, indoor space without wind noise or other people nearby
- Keep your video on and check that your lighting is adequate
- Please do not eat during the conference
- Make every effort to be on time, but if you are going to be late, email me before the scheduled time to let me know when to expect you

## Preparation

To make sure you get full benefit from the conference:

- Come to the conference prepared with specific questions; the conference is a time for you to use me as a resource, whether or not I have specific topics to discuss based on your draft
- Be prepared to take notes during the conference (if you type faster than you write, split the screen between Zoom and your notes, or use 2 monitors)
- Review the posted assignment instructions and and your submission before the conference

## Follow-up

- The day of the conference, complete the assigned exercise to email me a summary of the conference, including the main points we discussed and your planned next steps.

##### :x record conferences

I check the recordings to see if discuss the same issue with multiple students. If I do, I know to improve the class notes and website information about those issues.

##### :x  share the recording

I share the recording by forwarding students the Zoom email notification. IMPORTANT: do not click the "View Details" button, as only the host can see those details. You want to click the sharable link, which will take you to the recording and transcript.

Zoom also adds AI summaries and comments to these recordings. Please do not rely on them; I haven't found them to be very accurate.

##### :x check your settings.

The likely problem is that your Microsoft account and calendar are not both set to the Singapore time zone (even if your computer shows the correct time). To check:

1. sign into webmail at https://exchange.nus.edu.sg/
2. press the settings (1) button (the gear) on the top right of the page
3. under General (2) → Language and time (3), confirm that your time zone is UTC+08:00
   - if the time zone isn't Singapore, click on change (4) and choose the Singapore timezone
   - if the time zone is Singapore, change it to another time zone, and then change it back
4. under Calendar → View, check the "Display my calendar in time zone" and look for a "Yes, update" button to sync the calendar with the General time zone setting
