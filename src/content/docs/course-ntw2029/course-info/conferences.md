## Booking

This course uses Microsoft Bookings to schedule conferences. I'll send you a bookings link when conference times are made available.  Check the conference sign-up time carefully, as my Bookings page uses 24-hour time. If you see only strange times (like middle of the night), [:check your settings.](#x-checkyoursettings).

If you do not book a conference, miss your scheduled conference, or fail to turn your assignment in on time, you should not expect draft feedback or a conference for this assignment.

### Scheduling guidelines

I sometimes (but not always) send feedback for you to review before our conference. If time is short, you may receive this feedback just an hour before the conference. Thus, try to schedule the conference at a time when you will be able to review feedback in the preceeding hour.

## Conference logistics

Conferences are conducted over Zoom at <https://nus-sg.zoom.us/my/jonathanfrome>. If you have difficulties joining the Zoom, email or message me to let me know what's going on. I usually record conferences to improve my teaching materials and to give students access to the [:recording and transcript](#x-recordingandtranscript). If you want to be sure your conference is recorded, you must tell me at the beginning of the conference.

Please follow these guidelines to avoid distractions (for me) during Zoom conferences:

- Zoom
    - Test your audio and video using Zoom settings before the conference begins
    - Keep your video on
    - Close other programs (Zoom hogs RAM)
    - Plug in laptop / charge battery in advance
- Other
    - Find in a quiet, indoor space without wind noise or other people nearby
    - Check your lighting (not dark, not bright backlight/window)
    - Do not eat during the conference
    - Make every effort to be on time, but if you are going to be late, email me before the scheduled time to let me know when to expect you

## Preparation

To make sure you get full benefit from the conference:

- Make sure to watch any video feedback I send you. If you don't, the conference will not be nearly as productive.
    - If you don't receive a video by one hour before your scheduled conference, contact me to request it.
- Come to the conference prepared with specific questions
    - Although I'll give you feedback on important areas for improvement, I do not see it as my job to give you a list of tasks you need to complete to get an A paper
    - Conferences are a time for you to use me as a resource, which requires effort on your part to ask for guidance on specific issues
- Be prepared to take notes during the conference (if you type faster than you write, split the screen between Zoom and your notes, or use 2 monitors)

## Post-conference summaries

- After the conference (same day), complete the assigned exercise to submit the conference summary

## Post-conference support

After your conference, continue working on your paper with targeted support from me.

**Available support**:

- Answering specific questions about concepts, feedback, or writing strategies via email/Telegram.
    - [What counts as a specific question?](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences/#what-counts-as-a-specific-question)
- Scheduling additional meetings/conferences as time allows (note that conference weeks are busy, and I can't meet on weekends)
- Clarifying conference feedback you didn't fully understand

**Not available**:

- Reviewing emailed drafts or paper sections
    - [Why can't you review emailed drafts?](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences/#why-cant-you-review-emailed-drafts)

Remember: The conference gives you feedback on the most important issues with your draft. Additional support works best when you've already attempted to apply that feedback and hit specific obstacles. I suggest you first complete your post-conference reflection exercise to identify specific areas where you need help. Then, if needed, follow up with targeted questions about remaining uncertainties.

##### :x recording and transcript

I share the recording by forwarding students the Zoom email notification. IMPORTANT: do not click the "View Details" button, as only the host can see those details. You want to click the sharable link, which will take you to the recording and transcript.

Zoom also adds AI summaries and comments to these recordings. Zoom transcription is ok, but not great, so double-check anything important against the actual recording.

##### :x check your settings.

The likely problem is that your Microsoft account and calendar are not both set to the Singapore time zone (even if your computer shows the correct time). To check:

1. sign into webmail at https://exchange.nus.edu.sg/
2. press the settings (1) button (the gear) on the top right of the page
3. under General (2) → Language and time (3), confirm that your time zone is UTC+08:00
   - if the time zone isn't Singapore, click on change (4) and choose the Singapore timezone
   - if the time zone is Singapore, change it to another time zone, and then change it back
4. under Calendar → View, check the "Display my calendar in time zone" and look for a "Yes, update" button to sync the calendar with the General time zone setting

## FAQs

### Why can't you review emailed drafts?

While I do review drafts as part of the normal course assignments, I can't review additional emailed drafts (in part or in whole) for practical and pedagogical reasons.

- it takes just 10 seconds to email me a draft, so many students would ask for extra feedback
- the existing feedback schedule already occupies almost all of my time
- even short additional reviews would require many hours of additional work (it's hard to believe, but just 10 minutes per draft for all students adds up to roughly 6 hours work in reality)

Instead, submit complete work at designated checkpoints, prepare for conferences to take full advantage of them, and make appointments for additional help.

### What counts as a specific question?

Vague questions ask for reassurance without identifying a problem or a solution without showing that you've reflected on the guidance you've already received. Specific questions show you've identified what you're trying to achieve and where/why you're stuck. They show that you are taking ownership for developing your writing skills.

**Vague questions (avoid):**

- "Is my intro ok?"
- "Which source should I choose?"
- "Should I change my thesis?"
- "Does this paragraph work?"
- "Is my analysis good enough?"

**Specific questions (productive):**

- "My thesis claims X, but my third paragraph seems to argue Y. How can I align them?"
- "I'm trying to show Boyd's argument differs from standard evolutionary psychology. Does paragraph 4 make that distinction clear?"
- "My topic sentence says 'cooperation evolved through group selection,' but my evidence in that paragraph discusses individual benefits. Should I revise the topic sentence or put the evidence in a new paragraph?"
- "You said that I needed to explain what I meant by 'pleasure technology' or I should remove it. Does the following sentence explain it sufficiently, or do you still think I should remove it? [quotes draft sentence]"

Notice how specific questions identify: (1) what you're trying to do, (2) what you've already attempted, and (3) where exactly you need guidance. Often, specific questions also propose possible solutions. Formulating these questions builds writing skills.
