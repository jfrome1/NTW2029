## Booking

This course uses Microsoft Bookings to schedule conferences. Check the conference sign-up time carefully, as my Bookings page uses 24-hour time. If you see only strange times (like middle of the night), [:check your settings.](#x-checkyoursettings).

## Conference logistics

Conferences are conducted over Zoom at <https://nus-sg.zoom.us/my/jonathanfrome> or Meeting ID: 250 394 5161. If you have difficulties joining the Zoom, email or message me to let me know what's going on. I sometimes [:record conferences](#x-recordconferences) to improve my teaching materials and to give students access to the [:recording and transcript](#x-recordingandtranscript). If you want your conference recorded, you must tell me at the beginning of the conference.

Please follow these guidelines to avoid distractions during Zoom conferences:

- Find in a quiet, indoor space without wind noise or other people nearby
- Keep your video on and check that your lighting is adequate
- Please do not eat during the conference
- Make every effort to be on time, but if you are going to be late, email me before the scheduled time to let me know when to expect you

## Preparation

To make sure you get full benefit from the conference:

- Before the conference, review the posted assignment instructions and and your submission
- Come to the conference prepared with specific questions; the conference is a time for you to use me as a resource, not a time for me to give you a list of tasks you need to complete
- Be prepared to take notes during the conference (if you type faster than you write, split the screen between Zoom and your notes, or use 2 monitors)

## Post-conference summaries

- After the conference (same day), complete the assigned exercise to submit the conference summary

##### :x record conferences

I use recordings to see if discuss the same issue with multiple students. If I do, I know to improve the class notes and website information about those issues.

##### :x recording and transcript

I share the recording by forwarding students the Zoom email notification. IMPORTANT: do not click the "View Details" button, as only the host can see those details. You want to click the sharable link, which will take you to the recording and transcript.

Zoom also adds AI summaries and comments to these recordings. Do not rely on them; I haven't found them to be very accurate.

##### :x check your settings.

The likely problem is that your Microsoft account and calendar are not both set to the Singapore time zone (even if your computer shows the correct time). To check:

1. sign into webmail at https://exchange.nus.edu.sg/
2. press the settings (1) button (the gear) on the top right of the page
3. under General (2) → Language and time (3), confirm that your time zone is UTC+08:00
   - if the time zone isn't Singapore, click on change (4) and choose the Singapore timezone
   - if the time zone is Singapore, change it to another time zone, and then change it back
4. under Calendar → View, check the "Display my calendar in time zone" and look for a "Yes, update" button to sync the calendar with the General time zone setting
