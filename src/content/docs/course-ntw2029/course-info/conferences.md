- **Week 11**: Paper 2 explain positions conference
- **Week 13**: Paper 2 draft conference

## For a Productive Conference

The items below help us make the most of our conference time. Following them means we can focus on your draft rather than troubleshooting setup issues or catching you up on feedback.

### Before Your Conference

**Book your conference:**

- Book your conference when I send further instructions
- Check times carefully—schedule when you can review feedback during the 2 hours before we meet [:why this timing matters](#x-why-this-timing-matters)
<!-- - [:What if I see strange conference times?](#x-what-if-i-see-strange-conference-times) -->

**Review your work:**

- Review the assignment instructions and your submission before we meet
- Watch my video feedback, which you'll receive 2 hours before your conference (if you don't, contact me)

**Prepare questions:**

- Note any feedback that's unclear
- Identify any obstacles you need to overcome
- Prepare specific questions about your draft [:what counts as a specific question?](#x-what-counts-as-a-specific-question)

### Conference Setup

**Environment:**

- Find a quiet, private indoor space without wind noise or other people
- Check your lighting (avoid darkness or bright backlights)
- Do not eat during the conference

**Technical:**

- Test your audio and video before the conference begins
- Keep your video on throughout
- Close other programs before joining (Zoom uses significant RAM)
- Charge your laptop in advance

### Starting the Conference

- Join via Zoom: <https://nus-sg.zoom.us/my/jonathanfrome>
- Email or message me if you have connection difficulties
- Tell me at the start if you want the conference recorded [:about recordings](#x-about-recordings)

### After the Conference

- Submit your conference report the same day
- Ask specific questions via email/Telegram [:what counts as a specific question?](#x-what-counts-as-a-specific-question)
- You may request additional meetings, but my schedule is very tight during conference weeks.

## FAQs

### How do I access my conference recording?

I'll email you a link. I sometimes share recordings by forwarding my Zoom email notification. Click the sharable link in the email (not the "View Details" button, which only hosts can access). The recording includes an automatic transcript and AI-generated summary.

Note: Zoom transcription quality varies, so verify important details against the actual recording.

### Can I email you my revisions for more feedback?

I review drafts at scheduled checkpoints as part of normal course assignments. I cannot review additional drafts because:

- Students can email drafts instantly, creating an unsustainable workload
- The current feedback schedule already requires my full-time commitment
- 10 minutes per extra draft × all students = 6+ hours of additional work

Instead: Submit work at designated checkpoints, prepare thoroughly for conferences, and request meetings for specific help.

**Note on conference requirements:** Conferences require a submitted assignment, reviewed feedback, working audio/video, and a private space. If these basics aren't in place, we'll need to reschedule—and during busy conference weeks, another slot may not be available.

##### :x why this timing matters

Feedback sometimes arrives just two hours before your conference. If you're busy up until the conference, you won't be able to review the feedback by conference time, which is essential for a productive conference.

##### :x about recordings

Recordings help you review feedback later and help me improve my teaching materials. Recordings are not guaranteed unless you request them at the start.

##### :x what counts as a specific question

Vague questions ask for reassurance without identifying a specific problem. Specific questions show you've identified what you're trying to achieve and where you're stuck.

**Vague questions (avoid):**

- "Is my intro ok?"
- "Which source should I choose?"
- "Does this paragraph work?"

**Specific questions (productive):**

- "I can't figure out how to introduce ideas X and Y in this paragraph but still connect the sentences smoothly. [quotes 2-3 sentences] Can you suggest anything?"
- "You said to make my thesis less descriptive. Is this revised version better?"
- "You said I needed to connect my examples to my main point. I added this sentence [quotes it]. Does it do that?"

Notice how specific questions identify: (1) what you're trying to do, (2) what you've already attempted, and (3) where exactly you need guidance.

##### :x what if i see strange conference times

If you only see middle-of-night times, your Microsoft account timezone likely differs from Singapore time. To fix this:

1. Sign into webmail at https://exchange.nus.edu.sg/
2. Click the settings gear (top right)
3. Navigate to General → Language and time
4. Confirm that the timezone is UTC+08:00 Singapore
   - If not Singapore: change to Singapore timezone
   - If already Singapore: change to another timezone, then back to Singapore
5. Under Calendar → View, check "Display my calendar in time zone"
6. Click "Yes, update" if the button appears
