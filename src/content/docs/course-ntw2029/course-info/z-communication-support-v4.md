If you want help, don't hesitate to ask. It's almost always better to ask for help early, even if you're not totally sure you need it, then it is to try to solve things yourself and then realize that you're totally overwhelmed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should I  check the website vs contact you directly vs post in the group?

Check the website for:

- due dates
- assignments
- course policies
- formatting requirements
- grading criteria
- readings (soft copy download)

Contact me for:

- clarification of website info
- errors on the website [:Why?](#x-why-contact-you-directly-about-website-errors)
-
-
-
- . Contact me when you don't understand something after checking the website, need clarification about feedback, have technical issues, or when personal circumstances affect your coursework.



Post in the group when other students would benefit from the answer - questions about deadlines, assignment requirements, or course concepts. Message directly for personal matters, grade concerns, or questions specific to your individual work.
When should I contact you vs. check the website?


How should I write emails to you?
Write clear subject lines with "NTW2029" and your topic. State your request in the first sentence. For example: "I'm requesting a 24-hour extension for E03 because I have two midterms on the same day. Would this be possible?" This acknowledges you're asking permission rather than announcing a decision.

##### :x boundaries

I maintain communication boundaries for good reasons. It encourages you to plan ahead rather than panic at the last minute. It allows me to give thoughtful responses rather than rushed ones. And it ensures fairness - students who message at 2 AM don't get advantages over those who don't.

##### :x seeking-support

Reach out for support when you're consistently struggling to meet deadlines, not understanding content despite attending class, feeling overwhelmed by coursework, or dealing with personal issues affecting your studies. The earlier you reach out, the more options we have to help.

##### :x group-vs-direct

Post in the group when other students would benefit from the answer - questions about deadlines, assignment requirements, or course concepts. Message directly for personal matters, grade concerns, or questions specific to your individual work.

##### :x contact-vs-website

Check the website first for assignment instructions, due dates, course policies, formatting requirements, and grading criteria. Contact me when you don't understand something after checking the website, need clarification about feedback, have technical issues, or when personal circumstances affect your coursework.
