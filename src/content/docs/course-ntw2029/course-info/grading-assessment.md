## Grade Breakdown

- Class participation: 15%
- Exercises and Paper assignments: 15%
- Paper 1: 30%
- Paper 2: 40%

## Class Participation (15%)

I evaluate your engagement during class meetings based on:

- Being on time and letting me know about absences in advance
- Active engagement in discussions and small group work
- Coming to class with readings done and ready to discuss
- Helping the class develop understanding together

## Exercises & Self-Regulated Learning (15%)

Individual exercises are graded credit/no credit during the term. Getting a "complete" on all exercises typically earns a grade of 75%. To determine your final grade, I adjust this number based on how proactive you are in your learning process, a quality sometimes called "self-regulated learning" (SRL). This adjustment rewards students who genuinely work to improve their writing skills rather than just following instructions to earn a grade. More on [:why I incorporate SRL](#x-why-i-incorporate-srl) and [:how SRL is evaluated](#x-how-srl-is-evaluated).

### Exercise Grading Scale

Individual exercises are graded as:

- **Complete** (1 point) - all guidelines met
- **Complete on resubmission** (0.5 points) - after my feedback, your resubmission meets all guidelines (1 week maximum to resubmit, only 1 resubmission per exercise)
- **Incomplete** (0 points) - all guidelines not met, even in resubmission

Don't freak out if you get one or two incompletes. Each one is a very small part of the final grade.

## Paper 1 (30%) and Paper 2 (40%)

Grading criteria for the papers will be discussed in future classes.

Although you can still pass the course if you skip exercises, all paper assignments must be submitted at a minimum acceptable quality to pass the course.

##### :x what good participation looks like

- **Preparation**: Actually read the material (not just skim), come with opinions and/or questions, bring your materials.
- **During discussions**: Ask clarifying questions, build on others' ideas, listen actively. I value thoughtful wrong answers and genuine questions just as much as correct ones. This isn't a competition.
- **During small groups**: Focus discussion on the activity; ask me if you don't know what to do; if you finish early, ask what more you can do rather than chatting about other things.
- **During peer review**: Read classmates' materials beforehand, come in with comments, take an active role, ask questions rather than defending your views
- **Attendance**: Be on time and let me know in advance if you'll miss class or be late.

##### :x why i incorporate srl

Good writing develops through deliberate practice and reflection. It's not enough to just complete assignments - to get the most out of this course, you need to reflect on what you are doing to build your skills. Are you just following instructions as best you can in hopes of a good grade? Or are you thinking about your writing and learning and taking action to improve your abilities?

When you create an action plan after a conference, or when you use resources to understand a writing problem I pointed out in Paper 1 and learn to fix it in Paper 2, you're demonstrating self-regulated learning. Students who actively engage with feedback and course resources are the ones who improve their writing the most.

This part of your grade is to reward students who go beyond minimum requirements to improve their writing. If you consistently show that you're taking action to improve your learning (even if imperfectly), that will be reflected in your grade.

##### :x how srl is evaluated

I evaluate your self-regulated learning based on several factors. Beyond completing exercises, I'm looking at whether you:

- Pay attention to and follow course guidelines
- Use feedback to help identify writing skills to work on rather than as a checklist of errors to correct
- Work on writing skills using the course resources I provide
- Prepare well for conferences to use our time effectively
- Synthesize conference feedback into actionable plans (not just list what we talked about)
- Identify and prioritize the key issues in your writing
- Apply feedback from earlier assignments to improve later ones
- Show accuracy and insight in your self-assessments
