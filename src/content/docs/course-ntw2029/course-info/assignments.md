- All paper assignments (P02-09) must be submitted at minimum acceptable quality to pass the course
- Specific requirements are explained each assignment

## Extension Policy

- You may submit any assignment (except peer review) up to 12 hours late (i.e. automatic extension until noon the following day)
- No need to email me, explain, or apologize -- I trust you have a good reason
- Peer review assignments cannot be extended since delays affect classmates
- Extensions apply to final papers

## Formatting Requirements

### For All Assignments

Follow my formatting guidelines for all assignments (except E13, worload log). The easiest way is to download the [properly formatted paper template](/downloads/ntw2029-paper.docx) and check the comments ([:show comments](#x-show-comments) if needed). You can use the Word "styles" in that template to format your paper if that's easy for you.

If you use the template, or if you use margin comments as part of your editing process, remember to remove the comments before submitting the assignment.

You can also read the [:full formatting details](#x-full-formatting-details), which includes detailed instructions for how to set your settings for MS Word.

### Additional Formatting Requirements for Drafts and Final Papers  (P02-03, P07-09)

- Highlight your thesis statement in yellow (2 consecutive sentences maximum)
- Highlight all topic sentences in light blue
- Include reference list, start it on a new page at the end
- Italicize all titles in both body text and reference list

## Exercises (E01-E11)

**Counts toward**: Writing Development Work (15%) - graded complete/incomplete

Please don't spend more than two hours on any exercise (excluding reading time); they are for practice and learning, not for evaluating you

### Content Requirements

- Write in full sentences and paragraphs (unless the assignment says otherwise)
- Use proper grammar so I know errors aren't from carelessness
- Use formal style like an essay, not a casual email
- Choose simple, clear language over complex vocabulary
- Skip introductions and conclusions (exercises aren't full essays)
- Don't quote or cite sources unless specifically requested
- Don't do outside research

## Paper Assignments (P01-P09) Preliminary Writing (P01-02, P04-08)

**Counts toward**: Writing Development Work (15%) - graded complete/incomplete

Remember that drafts (P02, P07, P08) have additional formatting requirements (listed above).

## Final Papers (P03, P09)

**Counts toward**: Paper 1 (30%) or Paper 2 (40%) - graded with letter grades

Remember that final papers (P03, P09) have additional formatting requirements (listed above).

##### :x full-formatting-details

**Required formatting:**

- In [:paragraph settings](#x-paragraph-settings)
    - Set up double-spacing with left justification only (not justified on both sides)
    - Indent first line of each paragraph 0.5 inches or 1.25 cm
    - Remove extra space/blank line between paragraphs (Word usually adds this automatically)
- [:Insert page numbers](#x-insert-page-numbers) in the page footer
- Use [:12-point font](#x-12-point-font)
- In the Layout menu, set 1-inch or 2.5 cm [:margins](#x-margins) on all sides
- Center paper title at top of first page (no separate title page)
- Format citations and reference list in APA style (see Citations page)

If you can't find the settings window you need, [:use Word function search](#x-use-word-function-search)

There is no official grade bonus/penalty for correct/incorrect formatting, but exacting formatting is very important in academic publishing, and I've been in this business a long time, so I can't help formatting from affecting how I view a paper. I find it really pleasant to see correct formatting and quite annoying to see incorrect formatting, so your formatting determines my mood when I start reading your paper. You may not care about formatting, and I wish I didn't, but I do!

##### :x late-assignment-fine-print

"up to one letter grade per day late" technically means "up to one letter grade penalty applied at 1 min late and an additional grade penalty applied after each addtional 24-hour day"

## FAQs

### How do I remove comments from my Word document?

If your submission has comments, you must remove them before submitting your paper. <span class="smaller-text">  [:Why do I need to remove comments?](#x-why-do-i-need-to-remove-comments) </span>

To remove all comments:

1. Go to the Review tab
2. In the Comments section, click the arrow under "Delete"
3. Select [:"Delete All Comments in Document"](#x-delete-all-comments-in-document)

### What does "Remove extra space/blank line between paragraphs" mean? How do I do that?

Click to see what [:extra space between paragraphs](#x-extra-space-between-paragraphs) means.

Microsoft Word automatically adds extra space between paragraphs by default, but academic papers should not have these blank lines.

The provided template doesn't have them. You can remove them by highlighting the paragraphs and changing your [:paragraph formatting settings](#x-extra-space-formatting-settings).

##### :x why do I need to remove comments

Comments are like personal notes; they're for you, not your reader. It's professional to remove them. They are distracting if I want to add my own margin comments. Comments also [:make it hard for me to read submissions on Canvas](#x-make-it-hard-for-me-to-read-submissions-on-canvas).
