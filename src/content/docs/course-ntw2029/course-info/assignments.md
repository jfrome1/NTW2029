- Submit assignments as an attached Word document (.docx) - not Pages, PDF, or Google Docs
- Include at top: Your name, section (E1 or E2), GenAI link/non-use statement, word count
- You can resubmit unlimited times until the deadline; I grade only the last submission
- All paper assignments (P02-09) must be submitted at minimum acceptable quality to pass the course
- Specific requirements are explained each assignment

## Extension Policy

- You may submit any assignment (except peer review) up to 12 hours late (i.e. automatic extension until noon the following day)
- No need to email me, explain, or apologize -- I trust you have a good reason
- Peer review assignments cannot be extended since delays affect classmates
- Extensions apply to final papers
- Any further extensions will be granted only for serious, documented circumstances

## Formatting Requirements

### For All Assignments

Follow my formatting guidelines for all assignments (except E13, worload log). The easiest way is to download the [properly formatted paper template](/downloads/ntw2029-paper.docx) and check the comments ([:show comments](#x-show-comments) if needed). You can use the Word "styles" in that template to format your paper if that's easy for you.

You can also read the [:full formatting details](#x-full-formatting-details), which includes instructions for MS Word settings.

### Additional Formatting Requirements for Drafts and Final Papers  (P02-03, P07-09)

- Highlight your thesis statement in yellow (2 sentences maximum)
- Highlight all topic sentences in light blue
- Start reference list on a new page at the end
- Italicize all titles in both body text and reference list

## Exercises (E01-E11)

**Counts toward**: Writing Development Work (15%) - graded complete/incomplete

Please don't spend more than two hours on any exercise (excluding reading time); they are for practice and learning, not for evaluating you

### Content Requirements

- Write in full sentences and paragraphs (unless the assignment says otherwise)
- Use proper grammar so I know errors aren't from carelessness
- Use formal style like an essay, not a casual email
- Choose simple, clear language over complex vocabulary
- Skip introductions and conclusions (exercises aren't full essays)
- Don't quote or cite sources unless specifically requested
- Don't do outside research

## Paper Assignments (P01-P09) Preliminary Writing (P01-02, P04-08)

**Counts toward**: Writing Development Work (15%) - graded complete/incomplete

Remember that drafts (P02, P07, P08) have additional formatting requirements (listed above).

## Final Papers (P03, P09)

**Counts toward**: Paper 1 (30%) or Paper 2 (40%) - graded with letter grades

Remember that final papers (P03, P09) have additional formatting requirements (listed above).

##### :x full-formatting-details

**Required formatting:**

- In [:paragraph settings](#x-paragraph-settings)
    - Set up double-spacing with left justification only (not justified on both sides)
    - Indent first line of each paragraph 0.5 inches or 1.25 cm
    - Remove extra space/blank line between paragraphs (Word usually adds this automatically)
- [:Insert page numbers](#x-insert-page-numbers) in the page footer
- Use [:12-point font](#x-12-point-font)
- In the Layout menu, set 1-inch or 2.5 cm [:margins](#x-margins) on all sides
- Center paper title at top of first page (no separate title page)
- Format citations and reference list in APA style (see Citations page)

If you can't find the settings window you need, [:use Word function search](#x-use-word-function-search)

There is no official grade bonus/penalty for correct/incorrect formatting, but exacting formatting is very important in academic publishing, and I've been in this business a long time, so I can't help formatting from affecting how I view a paper. I find it really pleasant to see correct formatting and quite annoying to see incorrect formatting, so your formatting determines my mood when I start reading your paper. You may not care about formatting, and I wish I didn't, but I do!
