## Quick Decision Guide

**Do you need concrete information, like due dates, word count, etc.?**

- Check course info, assignments, or FAQs first
- Then TRY THE WEBSITE SEARCH BOX please!

**Are you confused about potentially incorrect information on the website?**

- Please contact me directly first so I can check and fix any errors before notifying the class.

**Do you need help interpreting instructions, guidance, etc.?**

- Please contact me; if instructions confuse you, they may confuse others, and I'd like to improve them. Just PLEASE carefully read the entire assignment first, as your question may be answered elsewhere in the assignment.

**Is your question private?**

- Email for things we should document (extensions, grades, special arrangements)
- Telegram DM for quick private questions
- Don't hesitate to ask for a conference for writing feedback or course issues

**Can we talk after class?**

- After class is great for short questions (<5 minutes), for longer questions better to set up a meeting time. I'm on campus most days.

## Contact Information

- **Email**: frome@nus.edu.sg

It's fine to contact me anytime. You won't wake me with messages/emails (I use 'do not disturb').

## Communication Methods

### Telegram Class Chat

**Best for**: Quick questions about course or assignments that might help classmates

- Join in first week
- Check daily / turn on notifications
- I monitor regularly and respond quickly
- DM me for quick private questions rather than posting in class chat

---

### Email

**Best for**: Anything requiring documentation or more context (arranging meetings, extension requests, grade concerns, personal matters, reporting website errors)

- Always include "NTW2029" in subject line
- I respond within one business day (usually not on weekends—plan ahead since deadlines are usually Sunday)
- If I don't respond, send a reminder (it's not rude—I give you permission because I can lose track of my MANY emails)

For tips on writing effective emails, see [How to Succeed](/course-ntw2029/course-info/how-to-succeed).

### Conferences

#### Informal Conferences (Anytime)

Request via email for clarifying class material, getting detailed feedback, or discussing course content. We can meet in person or on Zoom.

#### Formal Conferences (Weeks 6, 11, 13)

Required conferences for discussing your papers. See [Conferences](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences) page for full details.

## When to Ask for Help

Reach out early if you're:

- Consistently struggling to meet deadlines
- Not understanding content despite attending class and doing readings
- Feeling overwhelmed by coursework
- Dealing with personal issues affecting your studies

The earlier you reach out, the more options we have to help.
