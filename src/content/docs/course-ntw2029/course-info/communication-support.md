## Contact Methods

### How to Reach Me

- **Email**: Use email for formal requests (extensions, conference scheduling, grade concerns)
  - Include "NTW2029" in every subject line [:why this matters](#x-email-filtering)
  - Use both your formal name and preferred name so I know who you are
  - Expect response within one business day; email again if you don't hear back
- **Telegram**: Use class chat for quick questions and discussions
- **In person**: Grab me after class for quick questions or email to schedule longer meetings

### Don't Use These

Canvas messages and office voicemail - I don't check them

## When to Ask Questions

### Ask Everyone (Telegram or in class)

- Post questions about readings or concepts that confuse you
- Ask for clarification on assignment requirements
- Share resources or examples relevant to class
- Coordinate with classmates for notes or study groups
- Request help finding something on the website (after using search)

### Email Me Privately

- Ask about your specific paper topic or approach
- Discuss personal situations affecting your coursework
- Report website errors so I can fix them quickly
- Address problems with classmates or course policies
- Request exceptions or extensions beyond the automatic policy

## Getting Additional Help

I'm easily accessible and genuinely want to help you succeed.

- Request extra feedback on any assignment to understand my comments better
- Ask for clarification if feedback doesn't make sense
- Schedule additional meetings if you're struggling with concepts
- Email questions about course content (check website first)

If something isn't working for you, tell me early so we can fix it together.

##### :x email-filtering

I teach multiple courses and get hundreds of emails. Without "NTW2029" in the subject, your email goes to my general inbox where it might get lost among administrative emails and spam. With the course code, it goes straight to the right folder and I'll see it quickly. This isn't me being rigid - it's the only way I can reliably track student emails.

##### :x channel-choice

Basic rule: if it's just about you, email me. If others might wonder the same thing, ask publicly.

Think about whether your classmates would benefit from seeing the answer. "Can we use online sources for Paper 2?" helps everyone. "Can I write about my grandmother's art collection?" only matters to you. When in doubt, ask publicly - I can always tell you to email me if it's too specific.
