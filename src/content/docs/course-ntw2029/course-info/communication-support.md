## Contact Methods

### How to Reach Me
- **Email**: Best for anything formal (extensions, conferences, concerns)
  - Put "NTW2029" in the subject line every time
  - Use both your formal name and what I call you in class so I know who you are
  - I aim to respond within one business day - if you don't hear from me, just email again (I won't be annoyed, sometimes emails get buried)
- **Telegram**: Quick questions and class chat
- **In person**: I'm on campus most days - grab me after class for quick things or email for longer meetings

### Don't Use These
Canvas messages or office voicemail - I honestly don't check them

## When to Ask Questions

I want you to ask questions! Here's how to decide where:

### Ask Everyone (Telegram or in class)
- Can't find something on the website (after using search)
- Need clarification on readings or concepts
- Questions from class that might help others understand
- Coordinating with classmates for notes or study groups
- Sharing relevant examples or links

### Just Ask Me (email)
- Anything about your specific paper topic (not a good use of class time)
- Personal situations affecting coursework
- Website errors (tell me privately so I can fix them before confusing everyone)
- Problems with classmates or course policies
- Asking for exceptions or extensions

Basic rule: If it's just about you, email me. If others might wonder too, ask publicly.

## Conference Requirements

### Scheduling
- Minimum 3 conferences required per semester
- Book via Microsoft Bookings (uses 24-hour time)
- Conducted on Zoom: https://nus-sg.zoom.us/my/jonathanfrome

### Preparation
Before your conference:
- Review assignment instructions and your submission
- Prepare specific questions
- Have note-taking materials ready

During the conference:
- Find a quiet indoor space
- Keep video on with adequate lighting
- Don't eat during the meeting
- Be on time (email if running late)

After the conference:
- Complete reflection exercise same day
- Recording and transcript available upon request

## Getting Additional Help

I'm easily accessible and genuinely want to help you succeed.

- Ask for extra feedback on any assignment - I'm happy to explain my comments
- Request clarification if something doesn't make sense
- Schedule additional meetings if you're struggling
- Email questions about course content anytime (though check the website first)

If something isn't working for you, tell me early so we can fix it together.
