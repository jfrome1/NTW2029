## Quick Reference

- **Telegram class chat**: Fastest for quick questions about course or assignments
- **Email**: For anything requiring a record or more context (arranging a meeting, grade concerns, personal matters)
- **Conferences**: For discussion of your writing or course content; I'm on campus most days
- **Before class**: Not a good time; I'm prepping for class
- **After class**: For brief clarifications (<5 minutes)

## Contact Information

- Email: frome@nus.edu.sg
- Office: RC3-02-04K (same hallway as CR23)

## Communication Channels

It's fine to contact me anytime. You won't wake me (I use 'do not disturb').

### Telegram

- Join class chat in first week
- Check messages daily
- It's fine to message me directly with questions

### Email

- Always include "NTW2029" in subject line
- Check email daily
- I'll respond within one business day, email me a reminder if not (it's not rude, I give you permission because I can lose track of email)
- I usually don't respond to email on weekends, so plan ahead (note deadlines are usually Sunday)

### Informal Conferences

- Feel free to ask for informal conferences, I'm happy to meet
- Good for clarifying class material and for receiving more detailed feedback on assignments
- Best to arrange via email
- We can meet in person or on Zoom

### Formal Conferences

- There are three formal conferences per semester (weeks 6, 11, 13)
- See [Conferences](/course-info/conferences) page for details

### After Class

- Good for short discussions (<5 min)

## Do you need help?

If you want help, don't hesitate to ask. It's almost always better to ask for help early, even if you're not totally sure you need it, than it is to try to solve things yourself and then realize that you're totally overwhelmed.

Reach out for support when you're consistently struggling to meet deadlines, not understanding content despite attending class and doing the reading, feeling overwhelmed by coursework, or dealing with personal issues affecting your studies. The earlier you reach out, the more options we have to help.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### To get an answer, should I check the website, contact you directly, or post in the group chat?

Always check the website first for:

- due dates
- assignments
- course policies
- formatting requirements
- grading criteria
- readings (soft copy download)

Contact me directly for:

- clarification of website info, course material, feedback, assignments
- possible errors or problems with the website (it's best if I fix it before notifying the rest of the class)
- letting me know when personal circumstances affect attendance or coursework

Usually, it's best to contact me directly rather than posting to the class group chat, and I can post info for the whole class when I think it will be helpful for others.
