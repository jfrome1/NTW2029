## Before You Contact Me

I'm always happy to help, but if you're looking for basic course info you don't have (such as assignment requirements, class meeting dates, etc.) , first check the website.

Please use the website search box!

## When To Contact Me

- If you have information I've provided but need clarification or suspect an error, contact me.
- If your question is non-basic (topics you don't understand, how to write/revise), contact me.
- Always contact/email/message me directly rather than posting in the class chat. Class chat is for talking to other students.
- It's fine to contact me anytime. You won't wake me with messages/emails (I use 'do not disturb').

**Choose your channel:**

- **Telegram DM**: Quick, informal questions
- **Email**: Extensions, grades, special arrangements [:why email?](#x-why-email)
- **Informal meetings**: Writing feedback, course issues—request via Telegram, email, or in person

## Email Expectations

- Always include "NTW2029" in subject line
- I respond within one business day (usually not on weekends—plan ahead since deadlines are usually Sunday)
- If I don't respond, send a reminder (it's not rude—I give you permission because I can lose track of my MANY emails)
- Email etiquette - professional emails get faster, better responses. Here's what works:
    - Subject line: Always include "NTW2029" so I can find your email
    - Opening: Use both your formal name and what I call you in class, if different
    - Tone: Write like you're asking permission from a professor, not messaging your Grab driver. "May I meet with you after class?" works better than "I'll come see you after class." "Is it ok for me to leave class early due to an exam?" works better than "Just letting you know I'm leaving class 45 min early because I have an exam."

## When to Ask for Help

Reach out early if you're:

- Consistently struggling to meet deadlines
- Not understanding content despite attending class and doing readings
- Feeling overwhelmed by coursework
- Dealing with personal issues affecting your studies

The earlier you reach out, the more options we have to help.
