##### :x good questions

Good group questions that help everyone:

- "Is the assignment due at noon or midnight?"
- "What's the difference between primary and secondary sources?"
- "Is anyone else having trouble accessing the reading?"
- "Should citations count toward the word limit?"

Good individual questions:

- "Can I write about [specific topic] for Paper 2?"
- "I'm struggling with my thesis statement - can we meet?"
- "My grandmother is ill and I need to travel - can I have an extension?"

The key is thinking about whether other students would benefit from hearing the answer. When in doubt, use individual communication.

##### :x email tips

Write clear subject lines with the course code and topic: "NTW2029 - Extension Request for E03"

State your request in the first sentence: "I'm requesting a 24-hour extension for E03 because I have two midterms on the same day. Would this be possible?" This acknowledges you're asking permission rather than announcing a decision.

I can answer specific questions like "Should I cite paraphrases?" or "Can I use British spelling?" However, I can't review draft sections or answer vague "is this okay?" questions via email. Those need a conference.

##### :x seeking support

Consider reaching out for support when you're:

- Consistently struggling to meet deadlines despite your best efforts
- Not understanding content even after attending class and doing readings
- Feeling overwhelmed by coursework
- Dealing with personal or family issues affecting your studies
- Having difficulty adjusting to university life

The earlier you reach out, the more options we have to help. Seeking support demonstrates good judgment - many successful students use these resources regularly. There's no shame in asking for help when you need it.
