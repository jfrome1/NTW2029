## Quick Decision Guide

**Is your question on the website?**
→ Check course info, assignments, or FAQs first
→ If unclear after checking, contact me

**Would your question help others?**
→ Ask in Telegram class chat (I'll post answer for everyone if useful)

**Is your question private?**
→ Email for documented needs (extensions, grades, arrangements)
→ Telegram DM for quick private questions
→ Conference for writing feedback or complex course issues

**Need quick help during the week?**
→ Ask after class (<5 min questions)
→ Telegram DM (check daily, respond within hours)

**Need detailed discussion?**
→ Schedule conference (I'm on campus most days)

## Communication Methods

### Telegram Class Chat

**Best for**: Quick questions about course or assignments that might help classmates

**How it works**:

- Join in first week
- Check daily
- I monitor regularly and respond quickly
- If your question helps others, I'll post the answer for everyone

**You can also**: Message me directly with quick questions

---

### Email

**Best for**: Anything requiring documentation or more context

**Use email for**:

- Arranging meetings
- Extension requests
- Grade concerns
- Personal matters affecting coursework
- Reporting website errors

**Email guidelines**:

- Always include "NTW2029" in subject line
- I respond within one business day
- If I don't respond, send a reminder (it's not rude—I give you permission because I can lose track)
- I usually don't respond on weekends, so plan ahead (note: deadlines are usually Sunday)

### Conferences

#### Informal Conferences (Anytime)

**Best for**:

- Clarifying class material
- Getting detailed feedback on assignments
- Discussing course content

**How to arrange**:

- Email me to request
- We can meet in person or on Zoom
- I'm on campus most days and happy to meet

#### Formal Conferences (Weeks 6, 11, 13)

**Required conferences** for discussing your papers

See [Conferences](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences) page for full details

---

### Quick Questions After Class

**Best for**: Brief clarifications (<5 minutes)

**Not good for**: Before class (I'm prepping)

## When to Ask for Help

Reach out early if you're:

- Consistently struggling to meet deadlines
- Not understanding content despite attending class and doing readings
- Feeling overwhelmed by coursework
- Dealing with personal issues affecting your studies

The earlier you reach out, the more options we have to help.
