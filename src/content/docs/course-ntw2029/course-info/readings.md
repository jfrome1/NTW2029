## Reading guidelines

- On the schedule page, readings are listed for the day they will be discussed in class. For example, you should read Badcock 11-13 before class 2.1, and we will discuss it in that class.
- Please obtain access to the following books on writing, which are sometimes assigned as recommended reading:
	- _They Say / I Say_ (or TSIS) is Graff, Gerald, and Cathy Birkenstein. _"They Say / I Say": The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing_. 3rd ed. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2014.
	- _The Craft of Research_ (or COR) is Booth, Wayne C., Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams, Joseph Bizup, and William T. FitzGerald. _The Craft of Research_. 4th ed. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2016.
- All assigned readings will be provided both as hardcopies (distributed in class) and in pdf form through links in the reading assignments. Please bring all  hardcopies I give you (not just the ones listed that week) to every class until week 8. Due to my electronics policy, you will not be able to access the readings in class on your phones or laptops.
- Recommended readings will not be provided in hardcopy. You do not need to bring hardcopies of these to class.
- If you miss class, please arrange to have a classmate take a hardcopy of the reading to give to you later.
