## Contact info

- Office Phone: 6516 1366

- Office Location: Cinnamon West 02-09 (down the hall from our classroom)

- Email Address: frome [at] nus.edu.sg

- You can call me Jonathan, Dr. Frome, Professor Frome, or Prof Frome, or just Prof!

- By the way, it's best not to call your university instructors "Mr./Ms." as you might have done before NUS. That's not common in university.

## Dr. Jonathan Frome's mini intellectual history

I received a BA in Philosophy at Amherst College, an MA in English at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and a PhD in Communication Arts (Film Studies) at the University of Wisconsin—Madison. In graduate school, I learned about cognitive film theory, which aims to use cognitive psychology to understand how audiences respond to films. This theory sparked my continuing interest in the intersections between science and humanities. My dissertation research used cognitive theory to better understand some of the differences in emotional response between films and video games. After many years developing these theories of emotion, I have recently grown more skeptical about our ability to study emotional responses to media. Figuring out the capabilities and limitations of emotion research is one of my main interests. I also study video game theory, philosophy of emotion, and I am engaged in collaborative empirical research with psychologists at other universities.

Although I don't know you yet, I'm sure I share similarities with many of you. I did well in secondary school, demonstrated leadership in CCAs, and went to a very selective school for my BA. When I arrived, I was surrounded by talented people and was challenged by the work more than I ever had been before. I sometimes felt overwhelmed or suffered from [:imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). If that doesn't happen to you at NUSC, it will likely happen at some point as you go to increasingly competitive environments in graduate school, business, or other fields. It is a normal part of finding your place in the world, so expect it to happen and try not to let it undermine your sense of self.

## Teaching style & philosophy

- I try to be 100% upfront and straightforward. I'm not trying to trick you, keep things secret, or make you read my mind. If something's not clear, it's not on purpose—just ask and I'll clarify.

- I often use a method called the "Socratic method," named after the Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. The Socratic method involves me asking questions and then playing "devil's advocate" by challenging your answers. Often, you won't have an answer right away, and then your brain hurts. That's what learning feels like. The goal is to help you learn to think critically and to evaluate arguments.

- The Socratic method can sometimes make students feel like I am criticizing them personally or trying to make them feel dumb. Please know that I am not criticizing you; I am encouraging everyone to evaluate the answer. Don't take it personally! You are in class to learn the answers. You are not supposed to know them yet.

- If you suggest an answer that doesn't work, good for you for putting yourself out there and trying out an idea! I respect that.

- I am NEVER trying to make students feel bad. If you ever feel that I am making fun of you or another student, or being disrespectful, please tell me ASAP. I promise I won't hold it against you. I'm in a new culture in Singapore, and I may make mistakes, so please let me know if I do.

- I do not mind at all being interrupted during class with questions. Just raise your hand and ask. If you miss something, rather than whispering to your classmate (which is distracting), just ask me and I will happily go back to review whatever you missed.

- I have a dry or deadpan sense of humor, which means that I will sometimes make jokes without calling attention to the fact that I am making a joke. If I say something that seems ridiculous or odd, it's probably just me failing in my humor. Feel free to ask if I'm joking.

- When I am excited about something, I speak quickly. Ask me to slow down or repeat myself. I often can't tell if I'm speaking too quickly, so if you don't tell me, I won't know. You are not being rude; it's no big deal.

<!-- separate into sections for teaching style and teaching philosophy; the latter can include more about grading and purpose of the course, and explain why they might be frustrated by the course for not giving them simple answers  -->

## Additional notes on course expectations

- The ideas in this course are complicated. I don't expect that you will understand everything in the readings and discussion without help.

- If I use a word or concept that you don't know, just ask me what it means, and I'll tell you. I won't judge you or think you're dumb. It's not your fault if no one ever told you what "salient" means.

- Since students have very different backgrounds, I don't know what you already know. You must ask questions if you don't know something and want to understand it. Try not to worry about seeming dumb or slowing the class down. I promise you, if you have a question, others have the same question even if they don't speak up. I'll tell you if we need to move on and you should ask me your question later.

- I will often ask if you have any questions about what we've just discussed. DO NOT HESITATE to stop me even if you're not quite sure what you don't understand. Just say, "I didn't get that. Can you say it again?"
