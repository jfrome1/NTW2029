## Technology Requirements

### In Class

Keep electronic devices out of site during class (except for disability accommodations) to encourage focused thinking and discussion. I'll let you know when you can use devices during class activities. I provide printed lecture notes every class so don't have to worry about missing anything.

### Digital Setup

- Set up a digital calendar with all course deadlines and advance reminders
- Configure Canvas notifications to "Daily" or "Immediately" for Due Dates, Discussion posts, and Announcements ([:why these settings matter](#x-why-these-settings-matter))
- Download Telegram and join our class chat when I share the link
- Include "NTW2029" in every email subject line so it reaches the right folder

NOTE: I expect you to check these daily. If you don't, you will miss something.

## Classroom Conduct

### Attendance

- I expect attendance at every class meeting; communicate with me about any misses
- Sign the attendance sheet every class (make sure to sign if you come in late!)
- Please get notes from classmates for missed content and ask me any follow-up questions you have

### During Class

- Don't hesitate to ask questions--others probably have the same question!
- Drinks are ok, but don't eat during class
- Save side conversations for after class; it's a **really** small class and they are distracting (yes, we can see and hear you whispering and writing small notes to your classmate)
- If you have a question or missed something, just ask me to repeat myself--no big deal

## Academic Integrity

Using GenAI without submitting transcripts or failing to include the non-use statement constitutes academic dishonesty. See the full [GenAI policy](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy)

## Use of Student Work

I may use anonymized examples from student work to teach writing concepts in future classes. Your name and identifying information will never be included. Let me know if you prefer your work not be used this way.

##### :x why these settings matter

Although I rarely use Announcements, Deadline notifications have saved many students from missing assignments. Discussion notifications let you know when I respond to your post-class discussion posts.

##### :x why you should ignore the canvas gradebook

Canvas gradebook tries to calculate your final grade, but I track grades separately in my own spreadsheet. Canvas might show you have 50% when you actually have an A. Ignore it.
