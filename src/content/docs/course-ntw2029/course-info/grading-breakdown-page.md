## How Your Grade is Calculated

- Class participation: 15%
- Writing Development Work: 15%
- Paper 1 Final: 30%
- Paper 2 Final: 40%

## Class Participation (15%)

I evaluate your engagement during class meetings based on:

- Coming to class on time and notifying me about absences in advance
- Engaging actively in discussions and small group work
- Completing readings before class and coming ready to discuss them
- Helping the class develop understanding through your contributions

## Writing Development Work (15%)

This category includes all exercises (E01-E11) and paper prep work (P01-02, P04-08). Everything here is graded complete/incomplete.

### Grading Scale

All items in the 15% category are marked complete if you:

- Submit by the deadline (or within the 12-hour extension window)
- Include all required elements for that specific assignment
- Add a GenAI link or non-use statement at the bottom of the submitted document

Grading scale:

- **Complete** (1 point): All requirements fully met
- **Complete on resubmission** (0.5 points): Submitted on time and fixed after feedback (1 week maximum, only 1 resubmission per item)
- **Incomplete** (0 points): Not submitted on time, or resubmission doesn't fully meet requirements

### How Your Grade is Determined

Your grade for this category has two parts:

1. **Base score**: Getting "complete" on all items typically earns 75%
2. **SRL adjustment**: I adjust up or down based on how actively you work to improve your writing throughout the course

This adjustment rewards students who engage with feedback, use course resources, and take action to improve beyond just following instructions.

[:How SRL is evaluated](#x-how-srl-is-evaluated)

Don't panic about getting one or two incompletes - each item is a very small part of your final grade.

## Paper 1 (30%) and Paper 2 (40%)

These are your final papers only (P03 and P09). Grading criteria will be discussed in future classes.

All final papers must be submitted at minimum acceptable quality to pass the course, even if you skip some exercises.

**Preparation**: Actually read the material (not just skim), come with opinions and/or questions, bring your materials.

**During discussions**: Ask clarifying questions, build on others' ideas, listen actively. I value thoughtful wrong answers and genuine questions just as much as correct ones. This isn't a competition.

**During small groups**: Focus discussion on the activity. Ask me if you don't know what to do. If you finish early, ask what more you can do rather than chatting about other things.

**During peer review**: Read classmates' materials beforehand, come with comments prepared, take an active role, ask questions rather than defending your choices.

**Attendance**: Be on time and let me know in advance if you'll miss class or be late.

##### :x why-i-incorporate-srl

Good writing develops through deliberate practice and reflection. It's not enough to just complete assignments - to improve, you need to think about what you're doing to build your skills. Are you just following instructions hoping for a good grade? Or are you thinking about your writing and taking action to improve?

When you create an action plan after a conference, or when you use resources to fix a problem I identified in Paper 1 before writing Paper 2, you're demonstrating self-regulated learning. Students who actively engage with feedback and course resources improve their writing the most.

This part of your grade rewards going beyond minimum requirements to genuinely improve your writing. If you consistently show you're taking action to improve (even imperfectly), that will be reflected in your grade.

##### :x how-srl-is-evaluated

I look for evidence that you:

- Pay attention to and follow course guidelines consistently
- Use feedback to identify skills to work on, not just errors to fix
- Work on writing skills using the resources I provide
- Prepare well for conferences to use our time effectively
- Synthesize conference feedback into actionable plans (not just list what we discussed)
- Identify and prioritize the key issues in your writing
- Apply feedback from earlier assignments to improve later ones
- Show accuracy and insight in your self-assessments
