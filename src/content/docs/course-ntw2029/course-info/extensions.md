Any assignment, other than those for peer review, may be submitted up to 12 hours late for any reason (i.e. by noon the following day). This includes final papers. Don't bother to email me - no apologies or explanation are necessary!

Due to this policy, no additional extensions will be granted except in serious, documented circumstances.

If you are having trouble managing your workload, please ask for help. You can come to me or look into NUSC's [pastoral care resources](https://tinyurl.com/nuscpastoralcare).
