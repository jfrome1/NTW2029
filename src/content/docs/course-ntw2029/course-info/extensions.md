title: Extension policy

_If you email me in advance_, any assignment, including final papers, may be submitted up to 24 hours late for any reason.

To request an extension, just [:email me](/course-ntw2029/course-info/tech-guidelines/#course-email) ([:don't message me](#x-dontmessageme) for this purpose) and say "I would like a 24 hour extension on [name of assignment]. I will [:submit it by](#x-submit) [extended due date]." You can make this request up until the deadline; you don't have to ask further in advance. No apologies or explanation necessary!

I'll reply with "Extension granted" and I'll update your deadline on Canvas. I can't always reply to the email before the original deadline (some people write me at 11:50 pm asking for an extension, and I'm asleep) but you don't need to worry; this extension will be granted whether or not you receive a reply from me before the original deadline.

Due to this policy, no additional extensions will be granted except in serious, documented circumstances.

Of course, if you are having trouble managing your workload, please ask for help. You can come to me or look into NUSC's [pastoral care resources](tinyurl.com/nuscpastoralcare).

##### :x dont message me

I need a record of deadline extensions in one place. It's much easier for me to track requests in email than with messages.

##### :x submit

It's important that you explicitly commit to submitting the assignment by the extended due date.
