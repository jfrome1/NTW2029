title: Extension policy
---

Any assignment, including final papers, may be submitted up to 12 hours late for any reason (i.e. by noon the following day). No apologies or explanation are necessary! You don't need to email me.

Due to this policy, no additional extensions will be granted except in serious, documented circumstances.

If you are having trouble managing your workload, please ask for help. You can come to me or look into NUSC's [pastoral care resources](https://tinyurl.com/nuscpastoralcare).
