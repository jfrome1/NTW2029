## Technology Requirements

### In Class

No electronic devices visible during class. I provide printed lecture notes. Contact me if you need device accommodation for disabilities.

### Digital Setup

- Set up a digital calendar with all course deadlines and one-day advance reminders
- Configure Canvas notifications to "Daily" or "Immediately" for Due Dates, Discussion posts, and Announcements [:why these settings matter](#x-canvas-notifications)
- Download Telegram and join our class chat when I share the link
- Include "NTW2029" in every email subject line so it reaches the right folder

## Extension Policy

- Submit any assignment (except peer review) up to 12 hours late automatically
- Submit by noon the next day without emailing me or explaining
- This includes final papers
- Peer review assignments cannot be extended since delays affect classmates
- Request extensions beyond 12 hours only for serious documented circumstances

If you're struggling with workload, come talk to me early or check [NUSC pastoral care resources](https://tinyurl.com/nuscpastoralcare).

## Classroom Conduct

### Attendance

- Sign the attendance sheet every class for participation tracking
- Email me before class if you must miss
- Get notes from classmates when absent - I won't re-teach individually

### During Class

- Save side conversations for after class
- Raise your hand to ask questions - others probably have the same question
- Bring drinks if needed but don't eat during class
- Focus on our discussion and activities [:I notice engagement](#x-engagement-tracking)

## Academic Integrity

Using GenAI without submitting transcripts or failing to include the non-use statement constitutes academic dishonesty with serious penalties.

## Use of Student Work

I may use anonymized examples from student work to teach writing concepts in future classes. Your name and identifying information will never be included. Let me know if you prefer your work not be used this way.

##### :x canvas-notifications

Without proper notifications, you'll miss announcements and deadline reminders. "Daily" means you get one summary email each day. "Immediately" means you get notified as soon as I post something. Either works, but don't rely on manually checking Canvas - you'll forget. These notifications have saved many students from missing assignments.

##### :x canvas-grades

Canvas gradebook will show confusing numbers because I track grades separately in my own spreadsheet. Canvas might show you have 50% when you actually have an A. Don't panic about Canvas grades - I'll give you accurate grade updates when you ask.

##### :x engagement-tracking

I watch how you work in small groups. When you're discussing the assignment, great. When you're planning weekend activities or doing other coursework, I notice. This affects your participation grade. You don't need to talk constantly, but you need to be engaged with the course material when you're in class.
