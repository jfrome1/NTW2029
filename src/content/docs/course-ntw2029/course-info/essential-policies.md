## Technology Requirements

### In Class
No electronic devices visible during class. I'll provide printed lecture notes so you don't need them. If you need a device for disability accommodation, just let me know.

### Digital Setup
- **Calendar**: You must have all course deadlines in a digital calendar. Set one-day advance reminders so you don't forget assignments.
- **Canvas**: Set notifications to "Daily" or "Immediately" for: Due Dates, Discussion posts, and Announcements. Note: Canvas gradebook doesn't track your real grades - I do that separately.
- **Telegram**: Download the app and join our class chat when I share the link
- **Email**: Put "NTW2029" in every subject line so your email goes to the right folder

## GenAI Policy

You may use GenAI chatbots for any assignment with no penalty if you follow these rules:

### Requirements
1. Use only chatbots with shareable links (like ChatGPT)
2. Submit transcript links with every assignment
3. If you don't use GenAI, write: "I did not use GenAI in any way for this assignment"

### How to Share ChatGPT Links
Click the share icon → Create public link → Copy link
Don't copy the browser URL - it won't work for me.

### Not Allowed
- File uploads to GenAI
- GenAI tools integrated into Word/Google Docs
- Downloading files from GenAI

## Extension Policy

Any assignment (except peer review ones) can be submitted 12 hours late automatically - just submit by noon the next day.

- Don't email me about it
- No explanation needed
- Yes, this includes final papers
- No additional extensions except for serious documented circumstances

If you're struggling with workload, please come talk to me or check out NUSC's [pastoral care resources](https://tinyurl.com/nuscpastoralcare).

## Classroom Conduct

### Attendance
- Sign the attendance sheet every class
- Email if you must miss class
- Get notes from classmates if absent

### During Class
- No side conversations
- Raise your hand for questions
- Drinks allowed, no food
- Focus on class discussion and activities

### Academic Integrity
Using GenAI without submitting transcripts or failing to include the non-use statement will be considered an academic honesty violation with serious penalties.
