##### :x telegram appropriate

Telegram works best for questions that:

- Have short answers ("Is the assignment due at noon or midnight?")
- Might help other students ("Can you clarify what 'primary source' means?")
- Are about logistics ("Is class cancelled due to the holiday?")
- Need quick clarification ("Should citations go in the word count?")

Telegram is not appropriate for:

- Discussing your grades
- Explaining personal circumstances
- Requesting extensions
- Lengthy questions about your specific paper
- Anything you'd prefer to keep private

##### :x email format

Good email format helps me respond faster:

Subject line example: "NTW2029 - Extension Request for E03"

Start with your name and section if we haven't corresponded recently. State your request or question in the first sentence. Provide only necessary context. Use a respectful tone that acknowledges you're asking for something, not announcing what you're doing.

Example: "I'm requesting a 24-hour extension for E03 because I have two midterms on the same day. Would this be possible?"

Not: "I'll be submitting E03 late because I have midterms."

##### :x email questions

If your question has a straightforward answer ("Should I cite paraphrases?" "Can I use British spelling?"), email works fine. I can also answer specific either/or questions if you provide context about your thinking.

However, I can't review drafts or answer vague "is this okay?" questions via email. If I'd need to type several paragraphs to explain something, or if we'd need to go back and forth to understand what you're really asking, that's better handled in a conference where we can sort it out quickly through conversation.

##### :x boundaries

I maintain communication boundaries for several reasons:

For you: It encourages planning ahead rather than last-minute panic. You develop problem-solving skills when you can't get immediate answers. You learn to use available resources before asking questions.

For me: It allows me to give thoughtful responses rather than rushed ones. I can maintain work-life balance, which keeps me energized for teaching. It ensures fairness - students who message at 2 AM don't get advantages over those who don't.

For everyone: Clear boundaries mean consistent, predictable response times you can plan around.

##### :x seeking support

Consider seeking support when:

Academic challenges:

- You're consistently struggling to complete assignments on time
- You don't understand course content despite attending class and reading materials
- Your grades aren't reflecting your effort
- You're feeling overwhelmed by coursework

Personal challenges:

- Stress or anxiety is affecting your academic performance
- You're dealing with family or personal issues
- You're having difficulty adjusting to university life
- You need someone to talk to about challenges you're facing

Remember: Seeking help is a sign of good judgment, not weakness. The earlier you reach out, the more options we have for supporting you.
