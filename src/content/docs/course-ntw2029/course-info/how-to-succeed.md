## Email Etiquette That Works

Professional emails get faster, better responses. Here's what works:

**Subject line**: Always include "NTW2029" so I can find your email
**Opening**: Use both your formal name and what I call you in class, if different
**Tone**: Write like you're asking permission, not texting a friend or telling your Uber driver to wait. "May I meet with you after class?" works better than "I'll come see you after class."

## When and Where to Ask Questions

Choosing the right channel saves everyone time.

**Ask publicly in Teams or class** when others would benefit:

- Can't find something on the website after searching
- Questions about readings or concepts
- Coordinating with classmates

**Email me privately** for individual situations:

- Your specific paper topic
- Personal issues affecting coursework
- Reporting website errors (so I can fix them before confusing others)

Rule of thumb: If it's just about you, go private. If others might wonder the same thing, go public.

## Making Conferences Count

Good conferences happen when you come prepared. Before we meet:

- Review the assignment and your submission
- Write down specific questions (not "what should I fix?")
- Identify the hardest part for you

During our Zoom conference:

- Find a quiet indoor space (wind noise makes it hard to hear)
- Keep video on with your face visible
- Don't eat during the meeting
- Take notes actively - split screen or use two devices

I can record conferences if you ask at the beginning. You'll get the recording and transcript to review later.

## Understanding My Feedback

When I mark up your papers, here's what the formatting means:

- **Green highlighting**: Grammar or citation error (check citations page if unclear)
- **Light green text**: I can guess what you mean, but it's technically wrong
- **Bold text**: Wrong tone for academic writing or unnecessarily complex word choice

I also watch your small group work. If you're discussing the assignment, great. If you're planning weekend activities, I notice.

## Taking Ownership of Your Learning

The difference between B and A students isn't intelligence - it's what you do with feedback.

When I identify a pattern in your writing (like comma errors), I'll give you a resource. If Paper 2 has the same issues as Paper 1, that tells me you didn't use the resource. That affects your grade.

After conferences, strong students synthesize feedback into action plans. Weaker students just list what we discussed. Ask yourself: "What will I actually do differently?"

## Why No Electronics?

This isn't about being old-fashioned. The ideas we discuss are genuinely complicated, and devices promise easy answers that usually aren't there. The temptation to Google instead of think disrupts the kind of deep focus these topics need.

I provide printed notes so you can engage fully without worrying about missing information.

## The Real Secret

Most students think good grades come from following rules perfectly. Actually, they come from genuine engagement with the material and using feedback to improve.

Show me you're thinking about your writing, not just completing assignments. When you ask "How can I make this clearer?" instead of "What do you want?", you're on the right track.
