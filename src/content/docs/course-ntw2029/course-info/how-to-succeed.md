## Making Conferences Count

Good conferences happen when you come prepared. Before we meet:

- Review the assignment and your submission
- Write down specific questions (not "what should I fix?")
- Identify the hardest part for you

During our Zoom conference:

- Find a quiet indoor space (wind noise makes it hard to hear)
- Keep video on with your face visible
- Don't eat during the meeting
- Take notes actively - split screen or use two devices

I can record conferences if you ask at the beginning. You'll get the recording and transcript to review later.

## Read the Details

Class discussion helps you understand ideas, but the assignments contain much more than what we cover in class. Don't assume that understanding the lecture means you've fully understood the assignment. There isn't time to provide the same level of guidance in class as on the website.

Don't assume that your former teachers and I use the same words to mean the same things. Read assignments carefully rather than trusting that you've got the basic idea. Most of what I point out in feedback is already covered in the written guidance—time spent with the details is time well spent.

## Taking Ownership of Your Learning

The students that get the most out of the course are those that really engage with the resources I provide.

Use feedback intelligently. When I identify a pattern in your writing (like comma errors), I'll usually give you a resource to learn more, and you're always welcome to follow up with me. If Paper 2 has the same issues as Paper 1, that tells me you didn't use the resource and suggests lower engagement.

Strong students take ownership of improving their skills. Weaker students want me to tell them exactly what to do to fix all of the "problems" in their paper.

## Asking the Right Questions at the Right Time

When I teach writing, I often explain general principles for writing clearly. I explain why the principles work and illustrate them with concrete examples. Abstract questions about these princples are welcomed.

However, students who want to avoid mistakes will sometimes follow up by asking for detailed information about how to apply these principles or how balance one principle against another before they even have a draft to discuss. Actual examples:

- "Is there a rule for how many examples we should have per paragraph?"
- "Should we use the old vs new technique to make our quotes flow better in our explanations?"
- "How strongly should I state my claims in my paper 2?"

While these questions are very understandable, it's usually not possible to answer these types of questions.

Writing is a situated, contextual activity, meaning that you write about a specific topic in a specific way for a specific kind of reader. While it's important to understand basic writing principles, you really can't discuss details about those principles outside of a concrete example, such as a paper draft.

Questions about specific choices require something concrete to look at. I can't tell you in the absract whether it's more important to include additional examples or to keep a paragraph brief and simple. Yet, I'm happy to look at an draft paragraph and tell you what I think works best in one particular instance.

That's why conferences happen after you've written something. When you ask "How can I make this clearer?" you're working with the material. When you ask "What exactly do you want?" before writing, you're trying to skip that process—and it doesn't work.
