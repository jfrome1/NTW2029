## Email Etiquette That Works

Professional emails get faster, better responses. Here's what works:

**Subject line**: Always include "NTW2029" so I can find your email
**Opening**: Use both your formal name and what I call you in class, if different
**Tone**: Write like you're asking permission from a professor, not talking to your Grab driver. "May I meet with you after class?" works better than "I'll come see you after class." "Is it ok for me to leave class early due to an exam?" works better than "I'm leaving class 45 min early because I have an exam."

## Making Conferences Count

Good conferences happen when you come prepared. Before we meet:

- Review the assignment and your submission
- Write down specific questions (not "what should I fix?")
- Identify the hardest part for you

During our Zoom conference:

- Find a quiet indoor space (wind noise makes it hard to hear)
- Keep video on with your face visible
- Don't eat during the meeting
- Take notes actively - split screen or use two devices

I can record conferences if you ask at the beginning. You'll get the recording and transcript to review later.

## Taking Ownership of Your Learning

The difference between B and A students isn't intelligence - it's engagement with the resources I provide.

75% of things I suggest to students in feedback are things I provided guidance on in the assignment. Read it carefully, don't trust that you got the gist of things in class.

Use feedback intelligently. When I identify a pattern in your writing (like comma errors), I'll give you a resource. If Paper 2 has the same issues as Paper 1, that tells me you didn't use the resource. That affects your grade.

After conferences, strong students synthesize feedback into action plans. Weaker students just list what we discussed. Ask yourself: "What will I actually do differently?"

## Why No Electronics?

This isn't about being old-fashioned. The ideas we discuss are genuinely complicated, and devices promise easy answers that usually aren't there. The temptation to Google instead of think disrupts the kind of deep focus these topics need.

I provide printed notes so you can engage fully without worrying about missing information.

## The Real Secret

Most students think good grades come from following rules perfectly. Actually, they come from genuine engagement with the material and using feedback to improve.

Show me you're thinking about your writing, not just completing assignments. When you ask "How can I make this clearer?" instead of "What do you want?", you're on the right track.
