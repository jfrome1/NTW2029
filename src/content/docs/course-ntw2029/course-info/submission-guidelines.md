## Extension Policy

Any assignment (except peer review ones) can be submitted 12 hours late automatically - just submit by noon the next day.

- Don't email me about it
- No explanation needed
- Yes, this includes final papers
- No additional extensions except for serious documented circumstances

If you're struggling with workload, please come talk to me or check out NUSC's [pastoral care resources](https://tinyurl.com/nuscpastoralcare).

## How to Write Exercises

Don't spend more than two hours on any exercise (excluding reading time). Exercises are for writing practice and reflection; they are not final papers.

Write exercises with:

- Proper grammar (so I know errors aren't from carelessness)
- Formal style (like an essay, not a casual email)
- Simple, clear language

Don't do these in exercises:

- Quote or cite sources (unless I specifically ask)
- Do outside research (that's not what they're meant for)
- Include introductions or conclusions (they're not full essays)

## Assignment Submission Requirements

For all assignments:

- Submit as an attached Word document (.docx)
- Include at top: Your name and section (E1 or E2)
- Include at bottom: Word count and GenAI links/non-use statement
- Can resubmit unlimited times until deadline (I grade the last submission only)

### Paper-Specific Requirements

For papers only:

- Format in accordance with this [properly formatted paper template](/downloads/ntw2029-paper.docx), check the template comments (`Review / Show Comments`)
- Highlight thesis in yellow (2 sentences max)
- Highlight topic sentences in light blue

## Exercise Completion Guidelines

For an exercise to be complete, it must fully meet basic guidelines:

- Be submitted by the deadline (or extended deadline)
- Include all elements of the specific assignment
- Include a GenAI link or non-use statement at the bottom

## Resubmission Policy

- You can resubmit any assignment unlimited times until the deadline
- I only grade the last submission
- For exercises marked incomplete, you have one week to resubmit for half credit
- Only one resubmission attempt allowed per exercise
