## Technology Requirements

### In Class

No electronic devices visible during class. I'll provide printed lecture notes so you don't need them. If you need a device for disability accommodation, just let me know.

### Digital Setup

- **Calendar**: You must have all course deadlines in a digital calendar. Set one-day advance reminders so you don't forget assignments.
- **Canvas**: Set notifications to "Daily" or "Immediately" for: Due Dates, Discussion posts, and Announcements. Note: Canvas gradebook doesn't track your real grades - I do that separately.
- **Telegram**: Download the app and join our class chat when I share the link
- **Email**: Put "NTW2029" in every subject line so your email goes to the right folder

## GenAI Policy

See the [GenAI Policy page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy/) for complete details about using AI tools in this course.

## Classroom Conduct

### Attendance

- Sign the attendance sheet every class
- Email if you must miss class
- Get notes from classmates if absent

### During Class

- No side conversations
- Raise your hand for questions
- Drinks allowed, no food
- Focus on class discussion and activities

### Academic Integrity

Using GenAI without following the course policy (see [GenAI Policy page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy/)) will be considered an academic honesty violation with serious penalties.

## Course Improvement & Privacy

To continuously improve this course and my teaching, I may:

- Use anonymized examples from your work in future classes (your name will never be attached)
- Record class sessions and conferences to create transcripts for improving course materials
- Analyze patterns in student work to identify areas where instruction can be clearer

All of this is done to make the course better for future students. Your privacy is protected - any examples or quotes used will be anonymous, and recordings are used only for course development, not evaluation.

If you prefer that your work or words not be used in any of these ways, just email me to opt out - no questions asked and no impact on your grade.
