## Grade Breakdown

- Class participation: 15%
- Exercises and Paper assignments: 15%
- Paper 1: 30%
- Paper 2: 40%

## Class Participation (15%)

I evaluate your engagement during class meetings based on:

- Coming to class on time and notify me about absences in advance
- Engaging actively in discussions and small group work
- Completing readings before class and coming ready to discuss them
- Helping the class develop understanding through your contributions

## Exercises & Self-Regulated Learning (15%)

### The Basics

Short exercises, quizzes, and preliminary paper assignments are graded credit/no credit during the term. Getting "complete" on all of these typically earns 75%. I adjust your final grade based on how proactive you are in your learning process - a quality called "self-regulated learning" (SRL).

[:Why I incorporate SRL](#x-why-i-incorporate-srl)

[:how SRL is evaluated](#x-how-srl-is-evaluated)

Please don't spend more than two hours on any exercise (excluding reading time). They are for practice and learning, not final evaluation.

### How to Write Exercises

- Write with proper grammar so I know errors aren't from carelessness
- Use formal style like an essay, not a casual email
- Choose simple, clear language over complex vocabulary
- Skip introductions and conclusions - exercises aren't full essays
- Don't quote or cite sources unless specifically requested
- Don't do outside research beyond assigned readings

### Exercise Grading

Requirements for an exercise to be complete:

- Submit by the deadline (or within 12-hour extension)
- Include all required elements for that specific assignment
- Add a GenAI link(s) or non-use statement at the bottom

Grading scale:

- **Complete** (1 point): All requirements fully met
- **Complete on resubmission** (0.5 points): Submitted on time and fixed after feedback (1 week maximum, only 1 resubmission per exercise)
- **Incomplete** (0 points): Not submitted on time or resubmission doesn't fully meet requirements

Don't panic about getting one or two incompletes - each exercise is a very small part of your final grade.

## Paper 1 (30%) and Paper 2 (40%)

Grading criteria for papers will be discussed in future classes.

All paper assignments must be submitted at minimum acceptable quality to pass the course, even if you skip some exercises.

## Assignment Submission Requirements

### For All Assignments

- Submit as attached Word document (.docx) - not Pages, PDF, or Google Docs
- Include at top: Your name and section (E1 or E2)
- Include at bottom: Word count and GenAI links/non-use statement
- You can resubmit unlimited times until the deadline; I grade only the last submission

### Assignment Formatting Requirements

The easiest way to understand formating requirements is to download the [properly formatted paper template](/downloads/ntw2029-paper.docx), see what it looks like, and check the comments ([:show comments](#x-show-comments) if needed).

[:Formatting requirements spelled out in list form](#x-formatting-requirements-spelled-out-in-list-form) with instructions for setting them in MS Word

- Set up double-spacing with left justification only (not justified on both sides)
- Indent first line of each paragraph 0.5 inches or 1.25 cm
- Remove extra space/blank line between paragraphs (Word usually adds this automatically)
- Use 12-point font
- Keep 1-inch or 2.5 cm margins on all sides
- Center paper title at top of first page (no separate title page)
- Format citations and reference list in APA style (see Citations page)

### Additional Requirements for Papers Only (drafts and final papers, not all preliminary paper assignments)

- Highlight your thesis statement in yellow (2 sentences maximum)
- Highlight all topic sentences in light blue
- Start reference list on a new page at the end
- Italicize all titles in both text and reference list

##### :x what-good-participation-looks-like

**Preparation**: Actually read the material (not just skim), come with opinions and/or questions, bring your materials.

**During discussions**: Ask clarifying questions, build on others' ideas, listen actively. I value thoughtful wrong answers and genuine questions just as much as correct ones. This isn't a competition.

**During small groups**: Focus discussion on the activity. Ask me if you don't know what to do. If you finish early, ask what more you can do rather than chatting about other things.

**During peer review**: Read classmates' materials beforehand, come with comments prepared, take an active role, ask questions rather than defending your choices.

**Attendance**: Be on time and let me know in advance if you'll miss class or be late.

##### :x why-i-incorporate-srl

Good writing develops through deliberate practice and reflection. It's not enough to just complete assignments - to improve, you need to think about what you're doing to build your skills. Are you just following instructions hoping for a good grade? Or are you thinking about your writing and taking action to improve?

When you create an action plan after a conference, or when you use resources to fix a problem I identified in Paper 1 before writing Paper 2, you're demonstrating self-regulated learning. Students who actively engage with feedback and course resources improve their writing the most.

This part of your grade rewards going beyond minimum requirements to genuinely improve your writing. If you consistently show you're taking action to improve (even imperfectly), that will be reflected in your grade.

##### :x how-srl-is-evaluated

I look for evidence that you:

- Pay attention to and follow course guidelines consistently
- Use feedback to identify skills to work on, not just errors to fix
- Work on writing skills using the resources I provide
- Prepare well for conferences to use our time effectively
- Synthesize conference feedback into actionable plans (not just list what we discussed)
- Identify and prioritize the key issues in your writing
- Apply feedback from earlier assignments to improve later ones
- Show accuracy and insight in your self-assessments
