## Conference Types and Timing

This course includes three required conferences:

- **Week 6**: Paper 1 draft conference
- **Week 11**: Paper 2 explain positions conference
- **Week 13**: Paper 2 draft conference

## Booking Requirements

- Book your conference through Microsoft Bookings when link is sent
- Check times carefully - Bookings uses 24-hour time format
- Book a time when you are free to review my feedback in the hour before conference [:why this timing matters](#x-timing-matters)
- **If you don't book a conference on time, miss your conference, or submit asignment late: no guarantee for feedback or conference for that assignment**

## Conference Preparation

- Watch video feedback before conference (if sent)
- Contact instructor if no video received by 1 hour before conference
- Prepare specific questions about your draft [:what makes a good question](#x-good-questions)

- Email or message instructor if you have connection difficulties
- Tell instructor at start if you want conference recorded [:about recordings](#x-about-recordings)
- Follow Zoom guidelines:
    - Test audio and video before conference
    - Keep video on
    - Close other programs (Zoom uses significant RAM)
    - Charge laptop in advance
- Follow environment guidelines:
    - Use quiet, indoor space without wind noise
    - Check lighting (avoid darkness or bright backlights)
    - Do not eat during conference
    - Arrive on time or email instructor before scheduled time if late

## FAQs

### How do I access my conference recording?

I share recordings by forwarding the Zoom email notification. Click the sharable link in the email (not the "View Details" button, which only hosts can access). The recording includes an automatic transcript and AI-generated summary.

Note: Zoom transcription quality varies, so verify important details against the actual recording.

### What if I see strange conference times in Bookings?

If you only see middle-of-night times, your Microsoft account timezone likely differs from Singapore time. To fix:

1. Sign into webmail at https://exchange.nus.edu.sg/
2. Click the settings gear (top right)
3. Navigate to General → Language and time
4. Confirm timezone is UTC+08:00 Singapore
   - If not Singapore: change to Singapore timezone
   - If already Singapore: change to another timezone, then back to Singapore
5. Under Calendar → View, check "Display my calendar in time zone"
6. Click "Yes, update" if button appears

### What makes a good conference question?

Productive questions show you've identified what you're trying to achieve and where you're stuck. They demonstrate ownership of your writing development.

**Vague questions (avoid):**

- "Is my intro ok?"
- "Which source should I choose?"
- "Should I change my thesis?"

**Specific questions (productive):**

- "My thesis claims X, but paragraph 3 argues Y. How can I align them?"
- "I'm trying to show Boyd differs from standard EP. Does paragraph 4 make this clear?"
- "You said to explain 'pleasure technology' or remove it. Is this explanation sufficient? [quotes draft]"

Good questions identify: (1) what you're trying to do, (2) what you've attempted, and (3) where you need guidance.

### Why can't you review drafts between conferences?

I review drafts at scheduled checkpoints as part of normal course assignments. I cannot review additional drafts because:

- Students can email drafts instantly, creating unsustainable workload
- Current feedback schedule already requires full-time commitment
- 10 minutes per extra draft × all students = 6+ hours additional work

Instead: Submit work at designated checkpoints, prepare thoroughly for conferences, and request meetings for specific help.

##### :x timing matters

Feedback sometimes arrives just an hour before your conference. Scheduling when you can review it immediately before we meet ensures you get maximum benefit from our discussion.

##### :x good questions

Conferences work best when you actively guide the discussion toward your specific challenges rather than expecting comprehensive revision instructions.

##### :x about recordings

Recordings help you review feedback later and help me improve teaching materials. Recordings are not guaranteed unless you request them at the start.
