## Conference Types and Timing

This course includes three required conferences:

- **Week 6**: Paper 1 draft conference
- **Week 11**: Paper 2 explain positions conference
- **Week 13**: Paper 2 draft conference

## Booking Requirements

- Book your conference through Microsoft Bookings when I send the link
- Check the times carefully - Bookings uses 24-hour time format
- Schedule your conference when you can review feedback in the hour before [:why this timing matters](#x-timing-matters)
- **If you don't book a conference on time, miss your conference, or submit late: you may not receive feedback or a conference for that assignment**

## Conference Preparation

- Review my feedback before your conference
- Contact me if you haven't received feedback by 1 hour before your conference
- Prepare specific questions about your draft [:what makes questions productive](#x-productive-questions)

## During Conference

- Join via Zoom: <https://nus-sg.zoom.us/my/jonathanfrome>
- Email or message me if you have connection difficulties
- Tell me at the start if you want the conference recorded [:about recordings](#x-about-recordings)
- Follow these Zoom guidelines:
    - Test your audio and video before the conference
    - Keep your video on throughout the conference
    - Close other programs before joining (Zoom uses significant RAM)
    - Charge your laptop in advance
- Follow these environment guidelines:
    - Find a quiet, indoor space without wind noise
    - Check your lighting (avoid darkness or bright backlights)
    - Do not eat during the conference
    - Arrive on time or email me before the scheduled time if you'll be late

## After Conference

- Submit your conference summary exercise the same day
- Use these post-conference support options:
    - Ask specific questions about the feedback via email/Telegram
    - Request additional meetings if time allows
    - Request clarification of any conference feedback you didn't understand
- Do not send draft sections for review between conferences

## FAQs

### How do I access my conference recording?

I share recordings by forwarding the Zoom email notification. Click the sharable link in the email (not the "View Details" button, which only hosts can access). The recording includes an automatic transcript and AI-generated summary.

Note: Zoom transcription quality varies, so verify important details against the actual recording.

### What if I see strange conference times in Bookings?

If you only see middle-of-night times, your Microsoft account timezone likely differs from Singapore time. To fix this:

1. Sign into webmail at https://exchange.nus.edu.sg/
2. Click the settings gear (top right)
3. Navigate to General → Language and time
4. Confirm that the timezone is UTC+08:00 Singapore
   - If not Singapore: change to Singapore timezone
   - If already Singapore: change to another timezone, then back to Singapore
5. Under Calendar → View, check "Display my calendar in time zone"
6. Click "Yes, update" if the button appears

### Why can't you review drafts between conferences?

I review drafts at scheduled checkpoints as part of the normal course assignments. I cannot review additional drafts because:

- Students can email drafts instantly, creating an unsustainable workload
- The current feedback schedule already requires my full-time commitment
- 10 minutes per extra draft × all students = 6+ hours of additional work

Instead: Submit work at designated checkpoints, prepare thoroughly for conferences, and request meetings for specific help.

##### :x timing matters

Feedback sometimes arrives just an hour before your conference. Scheduling when you can review it immediately before we meet ensures you get maximum benefit from our discussion.

##### :x productive questions

Productive questions show that you've identified what you're trying to achieve and where you're stuck:

- "My thesis claims X, but paragraph 3 argues Y. How can I align them?"
- "I'm trying to show Boyd differs from standard EP. Does paragraph 4 make this clear?"
- "You said to explain 'pleasure technology' or remove it. Is this explanation sufficient? [quotes draft]"

##### :x about recordings

Recordings help you review feedback later and help me improve my teaching materials. Recordings are not guaranteed unless you request them at the start.
