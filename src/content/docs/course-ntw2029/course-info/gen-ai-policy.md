GenAI is a tool we'll all be using more and more, so this course lets you explore its capabilities and limitations without penalty. The key is transparency—I need to see how you're using it to understand what helps or hinders your learning.

## GenAI Policy Requirements

You may use GenAI chatbots for any coursework with no grade penalty if you follow these requirements:

- For each submitted assignment:
    - If you use GenAI, submit links to all relevant chat transcripts
    - If you don't use GenAI, submit the statement "I did not use GenAI in any way for this assignment"
- Submit links/non-use statements at the top of the assignment, above the title
- Copy links using the share function, not browser URLs
- Use only text-based chatbot interactions (prompts and responses)
- Conduct all GenAI conversations in English
- Create a non-shared account for your GenAI platform and stay logged in when using it to enable link sharing
- Don't delete any course chats

Additional essential details below.

## Content Responsibility

You are responsible for all content you submit, regardless of its source. GenAI tools frequently fabricate citations, misrepresent arguments, and invent information that sounds plausible but is false. Assume GenAI is wrong about factual claims.

If you use information from GenAI in your work, you must:

1. Verify the information with a reputable published source
2. Cite that source in your work

Do not cite GenAI as a source for factual claims.

### Grade Impact

- GenAI use or non-use does not affect your grade if you declare it properly
- Assignments missing both GenAI links and non-use statement receive zero credit
- Non-declaration or prohibited uses are considered academic honesty violations, with serious penalties

## How to Submit GenAI Links

:::danger
Browser URLs do not work. You must use the share function to create public links.
:::

Below are instructions for sharing ChatGPT links; others are similar. Check that your share links work by opening an incognito or private browser window and visiting the link.

### ChatGPT Shared Link Instructions

1. Click the share link icon in your chat
2. Click "Create public link"
3. Copy the generated link (not the browser URL)
4. Paste this link at the top of your assignment, above any titles

### Non-Approved GenAI Uses

- Uploading or downloading files to/from GenAI tools
- Using GenAI integrated into other apps, such as Microsoft Office, Google Docs, or custom IDEs
- Creating, editing, and chatting about docs within the AI interface (e.g. the ChatGPT `/canvas` function, NotebookLM)
- GenAI models that are not confirmed to create special links that allow me to download conversations (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini are approved; Claude and DeepSeek are not approved)

### New Chat Guidelines

- Start a new chat for each assignment to keep chats organized
- Try to use just one chat per assignment (P01-P09 count as separate assignments)
- If you forget and have more than one chat for an assignment, submit links to all of them
- Submit entire chats regardless of length

### What Counts as GenAI Use

Any interaction with GenAI while working on an assignment counts as use, including:

- Checking spelling or grammar
- Asking questions that prove unhelpful
- Testing the tool without using its output
- Getting ideas or feedback

Submit all chats about course topics, whether or not you actually use anything from the chat.

### Chat Research Option

We would like to analyze anonymized chat transcripts and assignment submissions for research after grades are submitted. Although you must follow this GenAI policy, you may opt-out of being part of that research by emailing me at any time before next term, even after final grades are submitted.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why only chatbots?

Chatbot interactions provide clear documentation of your thinking process and the AI's contributions. Other GenAI make it difficult to:

- Understand what work is yours versus the AI's
- Track your learning process
- Evaluate the tool's impact on student development

Text-based chat transcripts show the complete interaction, making it possible to study how students use these tools and how they affect learning outcomes.

### Why are certain uses prohibited?

I need transparency to understand how you're using these tools and what you're learning. Chatbot transcripts provide that transparency, while file uploads and integrated tools don't. Also, basic chatbot features are free for all students, but advanced features often require payment. Restricting use to free features keeps things more fair for everyone.

### Why submit unhelpful or dead-end conversations?

It's valuable to know what students try that doesn't work and what AI tools can't do well. Understanding failed attempts helps me teach you better strategies and shows me where AI falls short. These "failed" conversations are often the most instructive for research purposes.

### Research purpose

This permissive policy isn't a trick or test. We genuinely want to understand how students use GenAI tools when there's no penalty for being honest about it.

The research aims to understand:

- How students actually use GenAI when given freedom to do so
- Which uses help or hinder learning
- How to better integrate these tools into education

Your honest use and documentation helps us develop better teaching approaches for future students.

### How does the instructor use GenAI?

I may use GenAI to:

- Generate questions for discussion, assignments, or quizzes
- Create writing examples for class discussion
- Revise course materials and handouts
- Edit (but not write) assignment feedback

### NUS GenAI guidance

NUS provides guidance on:

- [General use of AI tools](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-4)
- [Using AI tools for assignments](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-5)
- [Understanding plagiarism](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/copyright_essentials_teaching_learning_research/plagiarism)
- [NUS Code of Student Conduct](https://www.nus.edu.sg/celc/statements-and-e-resources-on-plagiarism/)

The key principle: you must be transparent about any assistance you receive, whether from humans or AI. This course requires that transparency through chat transcript submission.

### Is there really no penalty for using GenAI?

That's right - no grade penalty as long as you submit your chat transcript links. Your learning may suffer if you rely too heavily on it, but there's no policy violation.

### Can I upload files to ChatGPT?

File uploads and downloads are not allowed under course policy. You can copy-paste text into the chat, but no file uploads. This includes features like ChatGPT Canvas.

### What if I forget my GenAI declaration?

Every assignment must include either a GenAI link or statement of non-use to earn credit. Since there's no penalty for use, please don't risk getting a zero by forgetting the disclosure.

For exercises, if the declaration is missing, the assignment will be marked "incomplete" and you can resubmit with a working link within a week to get half credit. If not, no credit.

For papers, DON'T FORGET your declaration and check all links, because lack of declaration is an academic honesty violation.

### Do I have to use GenAI?

No, you're not expected to use GenAI. If you don't use it, just end your submission with: "I did not use GenAI in any way for this assignment."
