<!-- Paper 2 brief source summary and context -->

- Goal: describe how your source fits into its academic conversation.
- Logistics:
	- Identify the source you intend to analyze for Paper 2. Provide proper a properly formatted APA citation for your source as the title of this assignment.
	- Write two paragraphs: one describing your source's academic conversation, and one describing your source's contribution
	- Cite page numbers in-text when paraphrasing your source in this simple way: (4)
	- The two paragraphs together should be max 600 words.
- You have been thinking about a topic to write about. Remember that the topic is just a way to help you find a primary source to analyze for paper 2. Choose your main source before beginning this assignment.
	- IMPORTANT: it is easy to make a mistake by choosing a source that is just a literature review, because sometimes a literature review source will not clearly state that it is a literature review. Don't choose a literature review as your Paper 2 main source as it is nearly impossible to write a strong analytic paper about a literature review. Look at the Paper 2 topic proposal for information on how to tell if your paper is a literature review.
- Your source aims to add to an academic conversation. You can't properly analyze your source without understanding that conversation. Using your source, describe that academic conversation. Here are some questions for you to consider while writing your description:
	- What is the phenomenon that the conversation aims to understand or explain?
	- What is the knowledge gap or puzzling aspect of that phenomenon?
	- What have others said about this phenomenon?
	- Why is your source not satisfied with current knowledge or other explanations of the phenomena?
- These questions are to help you think; you don't need to answer each of these questions separately.
- You also don't need to do outside research to answer these questions; rely on your source, and make inferences if necessary (but be clear when you are doing so).
- After describing the academic conversation, in a separate paragraph, explain your source's attempted contribution to that conversation. What argumentative thesis does the source propose and defend? How does the source think their thesis adds to the academic conversation? You should be able to get this information from just the source abstract (if any), introduction, and conclusion.
