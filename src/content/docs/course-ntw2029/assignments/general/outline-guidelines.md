<!-- ## Outlines

Outline formatting requires

## Outline structure

- At the top, state Pinker's main points for the sections and arguments you plan to discuss (not all arguments in the chapter as a whole). Use two sentences maximum. These should be separate from the outline, above it, and not numbered.
- Follow these main points with numbered/lettered lines in a hierarchical outline form <!-- provide clear image/example here -->

<!--. It should have two levels maximum: [:points and subpoints](#x-points).
- At the end, include a correctly formatted reference list with only one source, Pinker, and format the citation for the source correctly.
- Do not include lines about the paper introduction or conclusion in the outline. The thesis stated above the outline will serve as the introduction to the outline.

## Outline content

- Paraphrase all points; do not use direct quotations. Cite page numbers for each point in parentheses (e.g.,  (22-23)); no names or years are needed.
- Attribute claims directly to the source (e.g., "Pinker argues that cooperation evolved...").
- Each point will paraphrase a claim from the source argument.
- Each point in the outline should contain exactly ONE complete sentence--not two or more sentences. Do not use more than one sentence per point.
- Each point should be [:a COMPLETE sentence](#x-complete) with a clear subject and verb, not a phrase or sentence fragment.
- Avoid using "this" or "it" as the subject of the points
	- Avoid: "This is an example of mate selection." [What is an example of mate selection? Identify it clearly.]
- Each point should be a STATEMENT—not a question.
	- Avoid: "What does survival have to do with sexual selection?" [not a statement]
- Each point should paraphrase [:a claim the source makes about its topic](#x-topic) (meaning a claim about an idea or about another author). Points should NOT make claims about the source as a piece of writing, or describe generally what the source does in the paper.

:::danger
 _The above guideline is very important!_ If you don't follow this rule you will end up describing the source as a piece of writing rather than actually summarizing its argument, and that's not the assignment.

### :x points

![points and subpoints](/images/outline-points.jpg)

### :x complete

Correct:

1. Dance movements convey sex-specific information indicating an individual's biological quality (352).
<br>	A. Male physical strength may be a mating-related quality conveyed through dance as more elaborate dance movements are challenging and require a higher level of coordination to be executed (352-353).
<br>	B. In contrast, female dance movements may provide information about their fertility (353).

Incorrect:

1. Dance movements and biological quality (352) (not a sentence)
<br>	A. Effects of male dance movements (352-353) (not a sentence)
<br>	B. Effects of female dance movements (353) (not a sentence)

Incorrect:

1. Action films and video games teach coping by:
<br>A. Balancing negative and positive experiences and creating a hierarchy among them.
<br>B. Integrating negative emotions into positive goals to pose activating challenges.

Problem: (1) is not a complete sentence by itself. (A) and (B) are not complete sentences by themselves. The incorrect format encourages the student to make a list of points without really summarizing them into increasingly broad ideas.

### :x topic

- Avoid: "Boyd gives several supporting examples." (describes how the source is written)
- Correct: "Boyd notes that one modern mechanism for punishing cheaters is a police force." (states the example used in the source argument)

- Avoid: "Pinker gives several reasons that music is pleasurable." (describes what the source author does in general)
- Correct: "Pinker argues that music includes sounds similar to those found in the EEA" (states Pinker's actual argument)
