## Overview

Students will submit outlines as part of the writing process. The outline is optional for Paper 1 and required for Paper 2.

There are two types of outlines: source outlines (which outline part of a source argument) and paper outlines (which outline your own writing). The guidelines are almost the same, with the few differences explained below.

## How to submit

Outlines are paper-related assignments, and should follow the paper submission guidelines on [how to submit](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/paper-guidelines#how-to-submit).

## Requirements

Before reading the requirements, look at this [properly formatted example outline](/downloads/ntw2029-outline.docx).

### Structure

- Instead of a title, start with a thesis statement  (either the source's thesis or your proposed thesis).
- The thesis should be two sentences maximum and  left-aligned (not centered)
- The outline should have two have two levels maximum: [:main points and subpoints](#x-main-points-and-subpoints).
- The outline should not have points for the introduction or conclusion.
- At the end, include a correctly formatted reference list with all sources cited in the outline.

### Formatting

Format your outline to match the example linked above. I recommend using the example as a template for your submissions, replacing the content with your own, and using the custom styles I created. Remove my comments before submitting.

You can easily mess up formatting even with this template (e.g. by copying and pasting text from web pages) so be sure to follow these requirements:

- follow the [paper formatting requirements](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/paper-guidelines#formatting-requirements)  (aside from the requirement to have a title)
- label main outline points with numbers and subpoints with small letters

### Points must summarize claims

Although these guidelines may seem restrictive, they are designed to make sure your outline is as useful as possible for actually writing your draft.

- Each point in the outline will paraphrase part of the overall argument (your paper's or a source's).
- Each point in the outline should contain EXACTLY one complete sentence, not two or more sentences. Do not use more than one sentence per point in any circumstance.
- Each point [:should be a COMPLETE sentence](#x-should-be-a-complete-sentence) with a clear subject and verb, ending in a period—not a phrase or sentence fragment.
- Each point [:should be a STATEMENT](#x-should-be-a-statement)—not a question.
- For a source outline, your points should NOT describe things the source does; they [:should concisely state your source's claims](#x-should-concisely-state-your-sources-claims).
	- This guideline is very important for source outlines! If you don't follow this rule you will likely end up describing the source as a piece of writing rather than actually summarizing its argument.
- For a paper outline, your points should NOT describe generally what your paper will do; they [:should concisely state the specific claims](#x-should-concisely-state-the-specific-claims) that your paper will make/support.

### Quotations and attribution

- Do not include source quotations. Use paraphrases only.
- Use simplified in-text citations with the page numbers for each point at the end of that point. e.g. (22-23)
- Attribute all ideas to their correct source, even though it may feel redundant.
	- avoid:  "Cooperation evolved..."
	- correct: "Boyd says that cooperation evolved..."

### Subpoints support points

The following guideline sounds straightforward, but it is hard to apply without practice:

- All subpoints must logically support their main points.

When writing your outline, look at any main point. Ask: if any of its subpoints are false, could the main point still be true? If the answer is yes, then the subpoint isn't actually supporting the main point. (We will discuss this in class as well.)

##### :x main points and subpoints

![points and subpoints](/images/outline-points.jpg)

##### :x should be a COMPLETE sentence

- [:complete sentence example 1:](#x-complete-sentence-example-1) (web examples use bullet points, I can't figure out how to label them)
- [:complete sentence example 2:](#x-complete-sentence-example-2)
- [:complete sentence example 3:](#x-complete-sentence-example-3)

##### :x complete sentence example 1

Avoid:

- Dance movements and biological quality (352)
	- Effects of male dance movements (352-353)
	- Effects of female dance movements (353)

- problem: none of these points are complete sentences; they are just topics

Better:

- Dance movements convey sex-specific information indicating an individual's biological quality (352)
	- Male physical strength may be a mating-related quality conveyed through dance as more elaborate dance movements are challenging and require a higher level of coordination to be executed (352-353)
	- In contrast, female dance movements may provide information about their fertility (353).

- better: these points are complete sentences

##### :x complete sentence example 2

Avoid:

- Action films and video games teach coping by:
	- Balancing negative and positive experiences and creating a hierarchy among them.
	- Integrating negative emotions into positive goals to pose activating challenges.

- problem: none of these points are complete sentences by themselves

An even better version would require a restructuring these points so main point 1 summarized the most important parts of the two subpoints.

##### :x complete sentence example 3

- Avoid: "This is an example of mate selection."
	- problem: "This" isn't a clear subject. What is an example of mate selection? Identify the subject clearly.
- Better: "Female bowerbirds choosing to mate with the males that built the most decorated mating nests is an example of mate selection."
	- better: the specific subject is identified (but sentence flow is poor)
- Even better: "Mate selection occurs, for example, when female bowerbirds choose to mate with the males that build the most decorated mating nests."
	- even better: a different subject makes the sentence flow more smoothly

##### :x should be a statement

- avoid: "What does survival have to do with sexual selection?" [not a statement]
- better: "Survival is not the primary driver of sexual selection."

##### :x should concisely state your source's claims

- example 1 (for a source outline):
	- Avoid: "Pinker gives several reasons that music is pleasurable."
		- problem: the point describes the source's writing activity, not their claim
	- Better: "According to Pinker, music includes sounds similar to those found in the EEA (8)."
		- better: conveys the source's actual claim/reason
- example 2 (for a source outline):
	- Avoid: "Boyd gives several supporting examples."
		- problem: the point is a general high-level description
	- Correct: "Boyd states that one modern mechanism for punishing cheaters is a police force (42)."
		- better: provides the specifc example Boyd uses
- example 3 (for a source outline):
	- Avoid: "The authors of this study seem to assume that musicality is universal in human vocal communication."
		- problem: a source outline should describe what the source says, not infer what it doesn't say
	- Correct: "The authors of this study say that a child with musicality would be able to succeed in any culture."
		- better: conveys the actual claim stated (you can discuss the implicit meaning of the claim in you paper, but not in a source outline)

##### :x should concisely state the specific claims

- example:
	- Avoid: "I will argue that a picture of a horse can be recognized by anyone."
		- problem: the point describes what the author intends to do but doesn't state their actual argument
	- Better: "Cohen's (1983) findings support the notion that a picture of a horse can be recognized by anyone, even a child."
		- better: the point makes the claim the paper will support
