title: Exercise guidelines
date: 2025-01-11
---

Exercises are intended as a way to practice and/or to reflect on your writing. They are not intended to take a very long time to complete. Don't spend more than [:one to two hours](#x-one-to-two-hours) on any exercise.

## How to submit

- Type exercises directly into the text box on the Canvas submission page (unless otherwise indicated).
- Please [:do not paste links to documents](#x-do-not-paste-links-to-documents) in the text box.
- Exercises are always [:due before midnight](#x-due-before-midnight) (11:59pm).
- You may [:resubmit exercises](#x-resubmit-exercises) until the deadline.

## Approach

The exercises _should_ be written:

- with proper [:grammar](#x-grammar)
- in a [:formal style](#x-formal-style)
- with a focus on [:simple language](#x-simple-language) and clear communication

The exercises _should not_ do these things:

- Don't quote or cite sources in the exercises unless I specifically tell you to.
- Don't do any [:outside research](#x-outside-research).
- Don't include introductions or conclusions for the exercises; they are not full essays and these elements are not needed.

## Grading

As exercises are for skill-building, not assessment, grading is based on closely following these guidelines:

- includes the name I call you in class and your section (E1 or E2) at the top of the exercise
- includes a word count and either a [GenAI link or no-use statement](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy) at the bottom of the exercise
- is submitted by the deadline (or, if an [extension is requested](/course-ntw2029/course-info/extensions), by the extended deadline) as described below
- includes all elements of the specific assignment (which requires reading the assignment carefully)

Each exercise is given a category and points:

- Complete: your submission follows all of the above guidelines (1 point)
- Incomplete: your submission does not follow all guidelines (0 points)
- Complete, late: your submission is incomplete but is revised to meet all guidelines _and_ is resubmitted within 24 hours of receiving the "incomplete" grade (0.5 points)
- Complete, bonus: your submission is top-quality work that stands well above the other submissions (2 points)

## Feedback

It is impossible to give detailed, individualized feedback on all exercises. I try to set feedback expectations for each exercise in the assignment. I will write comments on Exercise 2, so let me know if you don't see the comments so we can troubleshoot. You are always welcome to [ask for additional feedback](/course-ntw2029/course-info/need-help).

##### :x do not  paste links to documents

##### :x due before midnight

I don't want you staying up late to finish coursework. Proper sleep is important for physical and mental health as well as for learning and productivity. Prioritize it.

##### :x resubmit exercises

You may resubmit exercises an unlimited number of times until the deadline. You don't need to email me to explain anything. I will look at the last submission only.

##### :x grammar

Write grammatically so I know that any writing errors are not due to carelessness. Don't rush the exercises thinking you only need to proofread the papers. I need to see what your "good" writing looks like before the paper drafts so I know what I need to teach you.

##### :x formal style

By "formal style" I don't mean bureaucratic or pretentious writing; I just mean write it like an essay for class rather than a personal reflection paper, a causal email, or a bunch of notes.

##### :x simple language

Many students have been trained to demonstrate their intelligence by writing complex sentences with big, fancy words. Don't do that in this course. The ideas we discuss are complicated and "fancy" writing makes things worse. Demonstrate your intelligence by explaining these complex ideas in a way that's easy to understand, with an awareness of your target audience.

##### :x outside research

The exercises are a chance to practice your thinking, they are not small research papers where you are supposed to synthesize ideas from other people or sources.

##### :x one to two hours

Please aim to write each exercise in one hour at most (not including reading time). Exercises are not intended to take a long time to complete. They are to practice skills, not to demonstrate your learning. Don't treat them like final papers.
