title: Assignment feedback

---

I provide feedback in different ways based on the assignment. My goal is to give you as much guidance as I can within my available time and resources. You are always welcome to ask for clarification and/or more feedback.

### Grades/marks vs. feedback

For exercises and paper assignments, which receive points rather than letter grades, I first check if the submissions are complete/incomplete and post points. Later, I add and post feedback (comments). Be sure to check your assignments again for feedback when you receive notifications.

### Types of feedback

My feedback on assignments can come in several forms: an audio recording, written comments posted on Canvas, or comments on the assignment itself. For any of these, you may be surprised to find that the comments don't cover the whole assignment equally. I might not discuss every section of your paper, or the specific draft comments might seem to stop partway through. Sometimes students will say, "You only commented on part of my paper. Will you comment on the rest?"

I understand that it may seem strange that I don't comment on all parts of an assignment equally, so I'll explain why.

### What's the purpose of feedback?

Often, students' primary goal in their classes is to earn a high grade. They may recognize the value of learning and find the course interesting, but their focus on the final grade frames they way they view all aspects of the class:  assignments are written to earn a high grade, a good assignment is one that tells you exactly what you need to do to earn that grade, and good instructor feedback tells you everything to correct and how to do it to make your paper an "A" paper. On this view, the purpose of feedback is to help you produce an error-free paper, and an instructor who doesn't comment on all parts of the paper is not doing their job. While you may not have explicitly thought about the purpose of feedback, I suspect most of you see it this way intuitively.

In contrast, my goal in this course is to help you improve your writing as much as possible. I'd be happier giving you feedback without grades, and I grade assignments only because I'm required to. Given my outlook, there are many reasons I don't mark all parts of a paper equally:

- It undermines the course objective of helping you build writing skills. If I make detailed comments on your entire assignment, you will rely on me to find problems and tell you about them rather than learning to do it yourself. It saddens me when I get a revised paper and see that the student corrected all of the errors I marked on their paper and ignored a host of similar errors that I didn't mark. The revision may seem better to them in some shallow sense, but they are showing me that they haven't learned how to write better.
- Detailed comments on an entire draft are usually pointless, since most drafts need to be heavily revised. Comprehensive comments means correcting grammar mistakes on sentences that won't even appear in the final paper.
- Too many comments and suggestions can be overwhelming and can destroy your confidence as a writer. Expectations are now higher and you may be surprised to get so many suggestions for improvement. You'll also find it's not easy to figure out how to improve your writing in the ways requested. The amount of revision involved in writing an academic paper at this level can be surprising. Too many instructor comments can also cause you to ignore the many good qualities your assignment may have.
- It's impossible to mark every way a draft can be improved. Trying to do so would take 3 hours per assignment, and the goal of a "perfect paper" would still not be achieved because the revised version will still have dozens of ways that it can be improved.

### How I give feedback

When giving feedback, my focus is on helping you become a stronger writer overall, not just improving your paper to earn a particular grade. My feedback is meant to help you recognize recurring strengths and weaknesses in your writing. Detailed comments are intended to be examples of these strengths and weaknesses, and I expect you to read the comments, learn something new, and practice applying your new knowledge to the rest of your paper.

If I explain that one of your topic sentences has a certain problem, first check whether you understand my comment well enough to apply it to other situations. If you don't, ask me for clarification. If you do, you should take the initiative to check your other topic sentences for the same problem. Practice applying your new knowledge so you actually improve your writing, not just one assignment.

Since I am an instructor rather than a copyeditor, my comments are examples to teach writing skills rather than corrections to make your paper free of errors. This selective approach encourages you to think critically about your work, helping you become a self-sufficient writer.

Since there are countless ways to refine a draft, and time is limited, it's impossible to mark every potential improvement I choose my comments strategically, focusing on areas that will have the greatest impact on your development rather than marking every single issue

### The nuts and bolts of feedback

If you're interested, here are the logistics for giving feedback on papers and paper assignments. I first quickly go through all submissions to check for completeness/incompleteness. In terms of feedback, to be fair to all students, I (try to) spend a set amount of time on each paper. I read the entire draft first, making some initial notes as I go. I then provide overall comments (either recorded or written) highlighting the main strengths and areas for improvement. With any remaining time, I add marginal comments or use text styling to indicate areas for review, and I return the marked assignment to you.

I am currently experimenting with feedback rubrics and checklists as ways of giving additional feedback in a time-efficient manner. These are used for feedback, not grading.

If you have any specific questions about parts of the paper that I didn't explicitly comment on, just ask. I'm happy to respond to questions over email or messaging as time allows, or to schedule additional meetings during the week. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts.

I believe I can achieve my goals of helping you improve your writing without marking every instance of every issue in a draft. I don't feel that my role is to help you make your draft so good that it can't be improved, and (to be honest) neither you nor I have enough time to achieve that goal in one semester even if we wanted to. Of course, if you want to continue work on any papers for the course, such as to improve them for submission to an undergraduate journal, I'm happy to continue working with you to improve them.

## Feedback through text styles

When you submit paper assignments, I use text styles to provide feedback My hope is that marking some text quickly will be enough for you to figure out the errors on your own, and then I can spend more time giving you comments on higher-level issues.

What the text styles mean:

- green highlighting indicates either:
	- a grammar or writing issue (ask me if the issue is not obvious to you), or
	- an citation error (either content or formatting, ask me if you can't figure it out AFTER reading the citations page carefully)
- light green text means that, although I can probably guess what you meant, these words are misleading or technically incorrect in some way
- bolded text should be reworded because:
	- it has a meaning or connotation that doesn't fit the context, or
	- it is not the appropriate tone for academic writing (usually, too informal), or
	- it uses complex/"academic" vocabulary where a regular word would be just as good and easier to understand

## Removing my feedback for revision

Although you will want to keep a copy of my feedback, you also need a clean copy of your document that you can revise and resubmit. Here's how to:

- [:remove comments](#x-remove-comments)
- [:remove highlighting](#x-remove-highlighting)
- [:remove colored text](#x-remove-colored-text)
- [:remove bold text](#x-remove-bold-text)

Save your revised document under a new file name to ensure you have a clean version ready for revision and submission.

##### :x remove comments

- Open your document in Microsoft Word
- Go to the **Review** tab on the ribbon at the top of the screen

##### :x remove bold text

- Press **Ctrl+A** (Windows) / **Command+A** (Mac) to select the entire document
- While the text is still selected, press **Ctrl+B** (Windows) / **Command+B** (Mac) to toggle bold text off
