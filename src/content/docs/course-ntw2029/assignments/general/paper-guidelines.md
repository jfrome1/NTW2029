title: Paper guidelines
date: 2025-01-11

---

Students will submit several paper drafts and two papers  to develop their writing skills. These guidelines apply to papers and all paper-related assignments.

## How to submit

- Papers and related assignments should submitted as Microsoft Word documents (.docx).
- Please [:do _not_ paste links to documents](#x-do-not- paste-links-to-documents) in the text box.
- Papers are always [:due before midnight](#x-due-before-midnight) (11:59pm).
- You may [:resubmit papers](#x-resubmit-papers) until the deadline.
- Late submission of any part of the assignment may affect your grade up to 1/3 letter grade per day late.

## Requirements

Although paper assignments have different requirements, the following requirements apply to all full and final draft assignments:

- Start the first page with the following information at the top left-hand corner of the first page of all paper assignments (not in the header):

```text
Student Full Name (Nickname)
Prof. Frome - NTW2029
Assignment Name (e.g. Paper 1 draft)
Date submitted
```

- The paper must have a title that reflects the paper content and a reference list.
- The reference list should include _only_ sources that are cited within your paper; don't include sources you read that are not cited.
- After the paper, and before the reference list, put a word count and a GenAI link or non-use statement.

:::danger[Please note]
**_For full and final drafts, you must highlight your thesis sentence(s) in yellow and the topic sentence of each body paragraph in light blue_**.

## Formatting requirements

Academic paper formatting is very detail-oriented. You are responsible for making sure paper assignments are properly formatted according to the rules below. If they aren't formatted properly, I'll mark them "incomplete" and you'll have to resubmit them (with penalties for lateness if it's past the deadline).

However, I have made formatting very easy for you by providing a [properly formatted paper template](/downloads/ntw2029-paper.docx) with comments explaining the format (be sure to [:show them](#x-show-them)). You can even use this template for your submissions, replacing the content with your own, and using the custom styles I created. Remove my comments before submitting.

You can easily mess up assignment formatting even with this template (e.g. by copying and pasting text from web pages) so be sure to follow these requirements:

- Don't use a cover page, borders, backgrounds, or anything decorative (necessary figures, images, or tables are fine).
- Leave page headers completely blank/empty
- The paper title should be centered, separated from the first line of the essay by one line/space, in the same font as the paper body, and not bolded or underlined
- Add page numbers in the footer, but leave page footers blank otherwise.
- The body of the paper must be double-spaced, left-justified, with the first line of each paragraph indented,  without an extra space between paragraphs. Use [:these MS Word settings](#x-these-MS-Word-settings).
- The reference list must start on a new page, be double-spaced, left-justified, with a hanging indent for the first line of each reference item, [:without extra space between paragraphs](#x-without-extra-space-between-paragraphs). Use these [:reference formatting settings](#x-reference-formatting-settings) (these are different than the ones above; the custom style for references lists reflects them).

##### :x due before midnight

I don't want you staying up late to finish coursework. Proper sleep is important for physical and mental health as well as for learning and productivity. Prioritize it.

##### :x resubmit papers

You may resubmit exercises an unlimited number of times until the deadline. You don't need to email me to explain anything. I will look at the last submission only.

##### :x show them

##### :x without extra space between paragraphs

The space between the last line of one paragraph and and the first line of the next should be the same as the space between lines within a paragraph. Online essays commonly skip lines between paragraphs because it is harder to add tab indents to webpages than in word processors. Extra blank lines can help readability online, but it is not the correct style for academic essays. Follow the settings shown on this page to avoid them.
