## Assignment

### Purpose

This assignment helps you finalize a source for Paper 2 and develop a clear understanding of how your source fits into its academic conversation. Understanding this context is essential for crafting a successful analytical paper. When you identify the conversation your source participates in and its specific contribution, you'll be better positioned to analyze the source's claims in your final paper.

### Overview

You'll identify your main source for Paper 2 and write two paragraphs: one describing the academic conversation your source contributes to, and another describing your source's research approach and contribution to that conversation. This assignment builds on your earlier source proposal and prepares you for the more detailed source summary outline that follows.

## Instructions

1. Review the Paper 2 guidelines to ensure your source is appropriate for the assignment.
2. Identify the source you intend to analyze for Paper 2.
3. Format a proper APA citation for your source as the title of your submission, including a link to the source on the webpage of the journal or press where it was originally published. If the source doesn't have a URL, please link to the source search result link at NUS libraries.
4. Write two paragraphs (max 600 words total):
   - The first paragraph should describe the academic conversation your source intends to contribute to, including what your source says others have previously contributed to that conversation.
   - The second paragraph should describe your source's research approach and contribution to that conversation.
5. When paraphrasing your source, cite page numbers in-text in this simple way: (4)

## Guidelines

- Remember that the source you choose is a means to analyze an argument, not just a way to research a topic. Focus on selecting a source that makes clear claims you can analyze.
- Your source aims to add to an academic conversation. Consider these questions while describing that conversation:
  - What is the phenomenon that the conversation aims to understand or explain?
  - What is the knowledge gap or puzzling aspect of that phenomenon?
  - What have others said about this phenomenon?
  - Why isn't your source satisfied with current knowledge or other explanations of the phenomena?
- You don't need to answer each question separately; they're just to help you think about the academic conversation.
- To learn about the academic conversation context for your source, try these approaches:
  - Look at your source's introduction, where authors typically address what "they say" (other scholars' contributions and gaps in the literature)
  - Check the literature review page on the course website for relevant literature reviews in your topic area
  - Use Google Scholar's "cited by" and "related articles" features to see how your source connects to other research
- There's no need to do extensive outside research at this stage; rely primarily on your source and make inferences if necessary (but be clear when you're doing so).
- Pay attention to the source's abstract, introduction, and conclusion, as these sections typically clarify how the source positions itself within an academic conversation.
- Avoid choosing a literature review as your main source, as these typically synthesize existing research rather than making original arguments that you can analyze.

## Checklist

- Citation is properly formatted in APA style with link to the source
- First paragraph clearly describes the academic conversation the source contributes to
- Second paragraph explains your source's research approach and its specific contribution
- Page numbers are cited in text when paraphrasing (using simple format)
- Total word count is 600 words or less
- GenAI link or non-use statement is included

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist can remind you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it's not a comprehensive summary of all assignment requirements. You must read the complete assignment description to fully understand the requirements.
