## Purpose

This assignment helps you expand your P07 draft by discussing the significance of your analysis—what your work contributes to the academic conversation. Based on conference guidance, you'll identify specific ways to deepen your analysis. This draft will receive a conference where you'll get guidance on how to strengthen your final paper.

## Overview

Write a draft of up to 2750 words that includes everything from P07 (revised based on peer feedback) plus a required discussion of significance. You must also include at least 2 additional sources beyond the target article, commentary, and author's response (if relevant to your analysis). All papers must include thesis explaining the disagreement, supporting analysis, and significance discussion—what distinguishes stronger work is the depth and sophistication of this analysis.

## Requirements

Your draft must include:

1. **Everything from P07** (revised based on peer review):
   - Introduction (revised if needed)
   - Explanation of both positions (revised if needed)
   - Thesis explaining why they reach different conclusions (expect this to evolve from your working thesis—refinement, deepening, or reconceptualization is normal)
   - Analysis supporting your thesis

2. **Significance discussion** (required for all students): Explain what your analysis contributes to the academic conversation. You began thinking about this in P07; now develop it fully. Address questions like:
   - What does your analysis reveal about this criticism?
   - What's at stake in how this disagreement is resolved?
   - How does understanding why they reach different conclusions advance understanding of the topic?
   - What would resolving this disagreement require?

3. **At least 2 additional sources** beyond target article, commentary, and author's response (if relevant to your analysis). Use these sources to:
   - Provide background on concepts or theories
   - Verify or evaluate specific empirical claims
   - Understand technical terms or disciplinary context

### About Your Significance Discussion

Your significance discussion must show what YOUR ANALYSIS reveals, not just summarize what's at stake according to the authors.

**Good examples of significance discussion:**
- "This analysis reveals that the disagreement isn't about empirical evidence but about incompatible definitions of 'exploration,' suggesting future research should clarify conceptual frameworks before testing predictions"
- "Understanding that these authors use different methodological approaches helps explain why their conclusions differ, and shows that both may be correct within their respective frameworks"

**Not acceptable:**
- Generic statements ("this matters because it's important," "more research needed")
- Teaching mode ("students should care about this because...")
- Moralizing ("shows need for clarity")
- Just summarizing stakes the authors mention without YOUR insight

Your significance must show one specific consequence that connects directly to the difference you identified. It should name what becomes difficult, unclear, or unresolvable, and connect to specific research questions or methodological choices.

### Developing Depth

Stronger analysis often addresses one or more of these questions:

- What theoretical goals or disciplinary contexts make different approaches useful?
- What's gained and lost with each position?
- What would it take to resolve this disagreement?
- How do methodological commitments constrain possible conclusions?
- Why do these authors approach the problem differently?
- What patterns or structures drive the disagreement that neither author explicitly names?
- What makes this disagreement harder to resolve than it appears on the surface?

The conference will help you identify specific opportunities to deepen YOUR analysis based on what your draft shows. Possible directions include:

- Examining other commentaries on the same issue
- Evaluating empirical studies cited by either author
- Using the author's response to clarify or complicate your analysis
- Proposing what would resolve the disagreement
- Explaining why different approaches might suit different research questions
- Identifying what assumptions would need to be true for each position

Not all papers will develop depth in the same way. What matters is strengthening YOUR paper's particular analysis.

Depth often comes from getting below the surface to understand what implicit issues the disagreement reflects. This doesn't mean being clever for its own sake. It means:

- Identifying assumptions or commitments that aren't explicitly stated but drive the disagreement
- Examining details in cited research to understand why the authors disagree about what evidence shows
- Recognizing structural features of their approaches that explain why the disagreement persists
- Revealing patterns that neither author explicitly names

### If You Identify Limitations

If your analysis reveals specific limitations in one position's reasoning, you may discuss those limitations in P08, BUT your reasoning must emerge from YOUR analysis—not appeal to authority.

Frame limitations as consequences or implications rather than declarations of which side is right:

**Appropriate framing:**
"Smith's argument relies on assumption X. If X doesn't hold [explain why it might not, with evidence], then [explain consequences for Smith's conclusion]"

**Not appropriate:**
"Smith is wrong because Jones says so" (appeal to authority)
"Jones is right and Smith is wrong" (side-picking without analytical support)

Your discussion of limitations must emerge from YOUR analysis of assumptions, evidence, or methods, supported by additional sources or logical analysis you provide. Present it as explaining consequences of differences, not advocating for winners.

### Using Additional Sources Appropriately

**Appropriate uses:**
- Provide background on concepts or theories mentioned in articles
- Verify or evaluate specific empirical claims
- Understand technical terms or disciplinary context

**Inappropriate uses:**
- Introduce entirely new arguments not present in your chosen articles
- Substitute for close engagement with target and commentary
- Expand scope beyond your chosen criticism

Keep focus on analyzing the disagreement between target and commentary, using additional sources to support that analysis.

## Guidelines

### Building on P07

Revise your P07 draft based on peer feedback before expanding to P08. Your working thesis from P07 should evolve as you continue your analysis. Some theses will become more refined and detailed; others might significantly shift focus from explicit disagreement to underlying causes. Different paths are appropriate depending on what your analysis reveals.

Your new content will develop the significance discussion and deepen analytical work identified through your own analysis and conference guidance.

### Your Analysis Should Drive Everything

Whether discussing significance or identifying limitations, your reasoning must be something YOU contribute. Don't just cite one author against another—develop your own analytical insights supported by evidence and reasoning.

### Word Count as Maximum

The 2750-word maximum gives you space to develop your analysis fully and include everything you want feedback on. However, concise, focused analysis is often stronger than expansive, diffuse discussion. Use the space you need to make your argument effectively.

## Feedback

You'll receive a conference after submitting P08. The conference will assess what your draft shows you're capable of and provide specific guidance on how to strengthen your analysis for P09. This is similar to the P1 conference—the focus will be on what YOUR paper needs next, not general tiers of work.
