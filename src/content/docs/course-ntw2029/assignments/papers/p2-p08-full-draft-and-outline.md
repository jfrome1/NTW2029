## Purpose

This assignment helps you expand your P07 working draft into a full draft that we can discuss in conference.

## Overview

Write a draft of up to 2750 words that includes everything from P07 (revised based on peer feedback) plus an introduction,  required discussion of significance. You must also include at least 2 additional sources beyond the target article, commentary, and author's response (if relevant to your analysis).

## Requirements

Your draft should    include:

1. **Content from P07** (revised and integrated based on peer review). [:Building on P07](#x-building-on-p07)
   - Explanation of both positions (revised if needed)
   - Thesis explaining why they reach different conclusions (this should now reflect what your verification revealed and will likely evolve through refinement, deepening, or reconceptualization)
   - Analysis supporting your thesis (integrate evidence from your verification work—quotes showing characterization accuracy, examples of strengthened claims, etc.)
   - Additional sources (move from identification list to actual engagement in your analysis)

2. **Introduction**: Frame your analysis by identifying the articles, stating what the commentary criticizes, and previewing your thesis. [:How to write your introduction](#x-how-to-write-your-introduction)

3. **Significance discussion** (required for all students): Explain what your analysis contributes to the academic conversation. [:Developing your significance discussion](#x-developing-your-significance-discussion)
   - What does your analysis reveal about this criticism?
   - What's at stake in how this disagreement is resolved?
   - How does understanding why they reach different conclusions advance understanding of the topic?
   - What would resolving this disagreement require?

4. **At least 2 additional sources** beyond target article, commentary, and author's response (if relevant to your analysis). [:Using additional sources appropriately](#x-using-additional-sources-appropriately)

5. **Outline**: List all topic sentences from your draft in order, attached at the end of the document after your References section. After completing your draft, read through this outline to verify your argument flows logically and each paragraph advances your thesis.

## Guidelines

### Developing Depth

Stronger analysis often addresses one or more of these questions:

- What theoretical goals or disciplinary contexts make different approaches useful?
- What's gained and lost with each position?
- What would it take to resolve this disagreement?
- How do methodological commitments constrain possible conclusions?
- Why do these authors approach the problem differently?
- What patterns or structures drive the disagreement that neither author explicitly names?
- What makes this disagreement harder to resolve than it appears on the surface?

The conference will help you identify specific opportunities to deepen YOUR analysis based on what your draft shows. Possible directions include:

- Examining other commentaries on the same issue
- Evaluating empirical studies cited by either author
- Using the author's response to clarify or complicate your analysis
- Proposing what would resolve the disagreement
- Explaining why different approaches might suit different research questions
- Identifying what assumptions would need to be true for each position

Not all papers will develop depth in the same way. What matters is strengthening YOUR paper's particular analysis.

Depth often comes from getting below the surface to understand what implicit issues the disagreement reflects. This doesn't mean being clever for its own sake. It means:

- Identifying assumptions or commitments that aren't explicitly stated but drive the disagreement
- Examining details in cited research to understand why the authors disagree about what evidence shows
- Recognizing structural features of their approaches that explain why the disagreement persists
- Revealing patterns that neither author explicitly names

### If You Identify Limitations

If your analysis reveals specific limitations in one position's reasoning, you may discuss those limitations in P08, BUT your reasoning must emerge from YOUR analysis—not appeal to authority.

Frame limitations as consequences or implications rather than declarations of which side is right:

**Appropriate framing:**
"Smith's argument relies on assumption X. If X doesn't hold [explain why it might not, with evidence], then [explain consequences for Smith's conclusion]"

**Not appropriate:**
"Smith is wrong because Jones says so" (appeal to authority)
"Jones is right and Smith is wrong" (side-picking without analytical support)

Your discussion of limitations must emerge from YOUR analysis of assumptions, evidence, or methods, supported by additional sources or logical analysis you provide. Present it as explaining consequences of differences, not advocating for winners.

### Your Analysis Should Drive Everything

Whether discussing significance or identifying limitations, your reasoning must be something YOU contribute. Don't just cite one author against another—develop your own analytical insights supported by evidence and reasoning.

### Word Count as Maximum

The 2750-word maximum gives you space to develop your analysis fully and include everything you want feedback on. However, concise, focused analysis is often stronger than expansive, diffuse discussion. Use the space you need to make your argument effectively.

### Essay Structure

P07 was scaffolding that developed your understanding through verification and thesis development. Now you're writing a complete essay with proper structure. Don't paste P07 sections wholesale—extract insights and place them where they belong:

- Explanation of positions: where it contextualizes the disagreement
- Verification evidence: where it supports analytical claims about characterization or incompatibility
- Thesis: in the introduction
- Analysis: distributed across body paragraphs developing your thesis

Apply essay structure standards from Class 5.2: topic sentences start paragraphs, one idea per paragraph, rename concepts at paragraph starts rather than using pronouns.

## Feedback

I'll hold a conference after you submit P08 to provide specific guidance for strengthening your analysis in P09. The focus will be on what YOUR paper needs next.

##### :x building on p07

Revise your P07 draft based on peer feedback before expanding to P08. Your working thesis from P07 should evolve as you continue your analysis. Some theses will become more refined and detailed; others might significantly shift focus from explicit disagreement to underlying causes. Different paths are appropriate depending on what your analysis reveals.

Your new content will develop the significance discussion and deepen analytical work identified through your own analysis and conference guidance.

**Integrating Your Verification Work:**

Your P07 verification section doesn't need to appear as a separate labeled section in P08. Instead, integrate what you discovered:

- Your thesis should state what verification revealed (genuine disagreement, mischaracterization, terminological confusion, etc.)
- Your analysis should use verification evidence (specific quotes, characterization checks) to support claims about incompatibility
- If verification revealed mischaracterization, explain how that affects interpretation of the criticism

The verification process shaped your understanding. The integrated essay should reflect that understanding without preserving P07's scaffolding structure.

##### :x how to write your introduction

P07 focused on verification and thesis development without framing. Now that your working thesis has stabilized through peer review, write an introduction that:

- Identifies the target article and commentary you're analyzing
- Briefly states what the commentary criticizes
- Previews your thesis about what drives the disagreement
- Includes a brief significance statement (1-2 sentences) indicating what understanding this disagreement reveals or contributes

Keep your introduction concise. Your reader needs orientation to the specific criticism you're analyzing, not comprehensive background on the entire research area. Most effective introductions are 150-250 words.

##### :x developing your significance discussion

Your significance discussion must show what YOUR ANALYSIS reveals, not just summarize what's at stake according to the authors.

**Good examples of significance discussion:**
- "This analysis reveals that the disagreement isn't about empirical evidence but about incompatible definitions of 'exploration,' suggesting future research should clarify conceptual frameworks before testing predictions"
- "Understanding that these authors use different methodological approaches helps explain why their conclusions differ, and shows that both may be correct within their respective frameworks"

**Not acceptable:**
- Generic statements ("this matters because it's important," "more research needed")
- Teaching mode ("students should care about this because...")
- Moralizing ("shows need for clarity")
- Just summarizing stakes the authors mention without YOUR insight

Your significance must show one specific consequence that connects directly to the difference you identified. It should name what becomes difficult, unclear, or unresolvable, and connect to specific research questions or methodological choices.

**Placing Your Significance Discussion:**

Your paper should reference significance twice:

1. **Introduction:** After your thesis preview, include 1-2 sentences indicating what your analysis will reveal
2. **Conclusion:** Develop your full significance discussion here, explaining what your analysis contributes to the academic conversation

The conclusion is where readers expect to find "so what does this mean?" Your brief introduction mention orients them to expect significance; your conclusion delivers it.

##### :x using additional sources appropriately

**Appropriate uses:**
- Provide background on concepts or theories mentioned in articles
- Verify or evaluate specific empirical claims
- Understand technical terms or disciplinary context

**Inappropriate uses:**
- Introduce entirely new arguments not present in your chosen articles
- Substitute for close engagement with target and commentary
- Expand scope beyond your chosen criticism

Keep focus on analyzing the disagreement between target and commentary, using additional sources to support that analysis.
