## Purpose

This paper develops your ability to identify and analyze scholarly disagreements in academic conversations. You'll learn how different interpretations of evidence lead to different conclusions and practice evaluating what's at stake in theoretical debates within evolutionary psychology.

## Overview

Write a 2250-2750 word paper that explains and analyzes one specific disagreement between a target article and one of its commentaries. You'll work with one of several provided articles from *Behavioral and Brain Sciences* (BBS), focusing on a limited aspect of the debate rather than the entire article. Your paper will explain both positions, analyze the nature of their disagreement, and discuss its implications for the field.

## Requirements

## Assessment

All papers must include all core components. Paper quality is determined, in part, by the depth and sophistication with which you answer core questions about the disagreement. See P09 for details on assessment.

### Length and Format

- Follow all standard paper formatting requirements
- Include proper in-text citations and References section
- Highlight thesis in yellow (2 sentences max)
- Highlight topic sentences in body paragraphs in light blue

## Paper 2 Process

Paper 2 develops through six scaffolded assignments, each building specific analytical skills:

**[P04: Article Selection](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p04-article-selection-2520/)** (Week 9)
Choose your target article and explain its main argument. P04 ensures you understand the target before encountering criticism.

**[P05: Identify the Criticism](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p05-identify-disagreement-2520/)** (Week 10)
Select a commentary and answer 7 questions mapping the criticism and locating relevant target passages. P05 is comprehension work—understanding what each article says.

**[P06: Verify Positions](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p06-explain-positions-2520/)** (Week 10, 700-1000 words, conference)
Verify whether the commentary accurately represents the target's position, then articulate why these positions are incompatible. P06 catches misreadings before you build analysis on them.

**[P07: Working Draft](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p07-working-draft-2520/)** (Week 11, 1200-1500 words, peer review)
Develop your thesis explaining what drives the disagreement, with supporting analysis. P07 is where your own analytical thinking emerges.

**[P08: Full Draft](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p08-full-draft-and-outline-2520/)** (Week 12, up to 2750 words, conference)
Write a complete draft with introduction, thesis, explanation, analysis, and significance discussion. Include a simplified outline of topic sentences.

**[P09: Final Paper](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p09-final-draft-2520/)** (Week 13, 2250-2750 words, graded)
Polish and finalize based on P08 conference guidance. See P09 for complete assessment framework.

## Guidelines

### Developing Your Thesis

- Your thesis _should_ explain the disagreement and its implications
- Your thesis should _not_ make a case that one position is stronger than the other.
- You _should_ do analysis to figure out what you think, which will become your thesis.
- You should _not_ decide on a thesis and do analysis to defend it.

P07 provides detailed guidance on developing your thesis with diagnostic questions; P08 includes examples of thesis quality levels. Until P07, focus on understanding both positions without forming conclusions about which is stronger.

### Structure

Your final paper should:

- Include an introduction that orients readers to the disagreement and states your thesis
- Provide a target summary explaining the overall argument with focus on the disputed aspect
- Explain what the commentary challenges and why
- Analyze why these scholars reach different conclusions
- Discuss the significance of what your analysis contributes to the academic conversation
- Include a conclusion that summarizes your main points.

These may be one or more paragraphs each, depending on your paper's needs.

## Feedback

Feedback is described in individual assignments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About the Assignment

#### Why use pre-selected articles?

Experience has shown that article selection is one of the hardest and most time-consuming parts of analyzing an academic disagreement. The target articles include published commentaries that directly engage with the target's arguments. This approach gives you freedom to choose a topic without requiring you to find suitable sources on your own. This approach also ensures that I can be familiar enough with all target articles to provide real guidance, which couldn't happen if all 24 students wrote about different articles.

#### Can I change my article selection after P04?

Only if you discover during P05 or P06 that your chosen pairing doesn't have enough substantive disagreement. Consult with instructor before switching.

#### What if I can't find enough disagreement in my chosen pairing?

Don't assume that you picked a bad article or need to switch. Often, students who are not used to this sort of assignment think they've reached a dead end when, in fact, they have found exactly the place where deeper analysis might start.

#### How is Paper 2 different from Paper 1?

In P1, you explained someone else's argument clearly (expository writing). In P2, you'll analyze a disagreement between scholars to understand why they reach different conclusions (analytical writing). In P1, the stretch goal was analyzing gaps in the argument. In P2, the stretch goal is identifying significance of the disagreement beyond its explicit focus.

### About Sources

#### What counts as an "additional source" beyond target/commentary/response?

Any academic source that helps you understand concepts, evaluate claims, or provide disciplinary context. Sources must be from reputable academic publishers, and can include research cited in the commentary, theoretical background, or empirical studies.

#### How many sources is too many?

There's no maximum, but keep focus on analyzing your chosen disagreement. Sources should support that analysis, not expand into new territory.

### About Process

#### Why so many scaffolding assignments?

Each assignment builds specific skills: P04 ensures you understand the target before encountering criticism, P05 maps the criticism and gathers relevant passages, P06 verifies accuracy of characterization, P07 develops your thesis and analysis, P08 adds introduction and significance discussion.

#### What happens if I do poorly on P06—can I still succeed on P09?

Yes. The P06 conference identifies what needs strengthening. P07-P08 give you opportunities to develop those areas.

#### Can I get feedback between P07 and P08?

You get peer review after P07 and can request additional guidance via email or office hours.

### About Requirements

#### Does word count include references?

Word count includes in-text citations but excludes the reference list.

#### What if my paper is under/over word count?

There is no set penalty, but aim to stay within the allowed range, as expectations for depth of discussion are based on a paper of a set length.

#### How many quotes should I use?

Follow guidance provided in class discussion and notes about when to quote. Don't put quotations in without purpose. When discussing what the articles say, quote enough key claims and phrases to build credibility with your reader. Quotations are most important if discussing nuanced aspects of language that are central to your discussion, such as whether or not the target really said what the commentary suggests it says. In those cases, quotations are evidence supporting your claims.

### About Paper Depth

#### What's the difference between basic requirements and deeper analysis?

All papers must include all core components (explanation, thesis explaining why they differ, supporting analysis, significance discussion). Deeper analysis means more sophisticated insights about why they reach different conclusions, not additional sections. See P09 for detailed guidance.

##### :x how to write target summary

Provide an accurate summary of the target article's overall argument with focus on the aspect your chosen commentary challenges. Your summary should give readers enough context to understand what the commentary responds to without explaining the entire article.

Focus on accuracy and relevance. Include only what readers need to understand the specific disagreement you're analyzing.

##### :x understanding the commentary

Explain accurately what the commentary challenges in the target's argument, whether explicitly stated or implicitly assumed. This requires identifying:

- What specific claim, method, definition, or assumption the commentary questions
- Why the commentary sees this as problematic
- What alternative the commentary proposes (if any)

Accuracy matters more than comprehensiveness. Focus on the specific criticism you're analyzing rather than summarizing the entire commentary.

##### :x developing your thesis

Your thesis must explain why these scholars reach different conclusions. It should identify a specific difference (which definition, method, standard, or assumption differs), state what each version is, and explain how that difference produces different conclusions.

Your thesis should explain why they reach different conclusions. At minimum, accurately identify what explicit difference (definitional, methodological, evidentiary) drives the disagreement. More developed analysis examines trade-offs, implications, and consequences of each position—what's gained and lost with each approach, what each enables or constrains, what assumptions each requires.

P07 provides detailed guidance on developing your thesis, including examples and diagnostic questions. Until P07, focus on understanding both positions without forming conclusions about which is stronger.

##### :x writing significance discussion

Your significance discussion should reveal why understanding this incompatibility matters. Depending on your thesis, this might address: what resolving the disagreement would require, what becomes unclear or unresolvable, what the disagreement reveals about different approaches to the phenomenon, or what's at stake if the criticism were accepted.

See P08 assignment for detailed guidance, examples of strong vs weak significance discussions, and placement guidance.

##### :x supporting your thesis

Support your thesis with analysis using specific evidence and reasoning. Your analysis should:

- Use specific evidence from both articles
- Show how the difference you identified drives the disagreement
- Explain the logical connections between differences and conclusions
- Avoid simply asserting one side is correct

Stronger analysis often addresses questions like: What theoretical goals make different approaches useful? What would it take to resolve this disagreement? How do methodological commitments constrain possible conclusions?
