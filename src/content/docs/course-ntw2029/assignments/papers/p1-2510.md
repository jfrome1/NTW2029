## Purpose

This assignment develops your ability to explain complex academic arguments clearly and accurately. You'll practice charitable representation of source material, appropriate use of quotations, and clear attribution - essential skills for participating in academic conversations and for Paper 2's analytical work.

## Overview

Write an expository paper explaining arguments from Pinker's chapter "The Meaning of Life" about why humans enjoy art. The paper should explain both his general argument about art as a "pleasure technology" and one or two of his specific arguments about a particular art form (visual arts, music, or narrative fiction). Write for a generalist, educated audience who hasn't read Pinker or taken this course.

## Requirements

### Content

- Explain Pinker's general argument about why humans enjoy art (pages 521-526)
- Explain one or two specific arguments about ONE art form (your choice):
  - Visual arts (526-528)
  - Music (534-538)
  - Narrative fiction (538-543, avoiding tearjerker/benign masochism arguments)
- Define key evolutionary terms your audience won't know (EEA, reproductive fitness, adaptation/byproduct if used)

Note: don't write about music structure (528-534)

 ### Structure

- **Introduction**: Orient reader to the topic, explain the evolutionary puzzle, end with thesis
- **Thesis**: State Pinker's answer about why humans enjoy art and preview which specific arguments you'll discuss [:Examples of weak vs strong theses](#x-examples-of-weak-vs-strong-theses)
- **Body**: First explain general argument, then specific arguments for your chosen art form
- **Conclusion**: Brief restatement of main points

## Guidelines

### Approach

- Remember the questions from our class discussion: What is Pinker's main question? Is he explaining one phenomenon or many?
- Each mechanism Pinker discusses is a separate argument - identify the boundaries between them
- Focus only on arguments about why we enjoy art (not status or other topics)
- Apply the notetaking and explanation strategies covered in class

### Common Pitfalls

- Don't confuse Pinker's puzzle (why do we enjoy art?) with his answer
- Don't blur different mechanisms into one vague argument
- Don't use terms like "patterns" without specifying what kind
- Don't mix your examples with Pinker's without clarifying whose they are
- Don't attempt to evaluate whether Pinker is right

### Using Sources

- Attribute every claim from Pinker using signal verbs (states, argues, claims)
- Use 3-5 short quotes (under 40 words) for key terms, crucial claims, or evidence
- Frame all quotes with introduction and explanation
- Use consistent keyterms throughout; if Pinker doesn't, note this
- Distinguish your examples from Pinker's [:How to make this distinction](#x-how-to-make-this-distinction)

## Instructions

### Paper Development Process

1. **Source Outline** (optional but recommended) - Review outline guidelines from class
2. **Full Draft** - Complete version for conference feedback
3. **Conference** - Individual meeting to discuss draft
4. **Final Paper** - Revised based on conference feedback

### Analysis Option

Only include analysis if your conference feedback explicitly encouraged it. If so, you may identify ambiguities or limitations in Pinker's argument, but don't evaluate whether he's correct or propose alternatives.

## Feedback

You will receive extensive written and verbal feedback on your draft during your conference, followed by a letter grade with brief improvement comments on the final paper.

##### :x Examples of weak vs strong theses

Weak: "This paper will discuss Pinker's arguments about visual art."
Weak: "Pinker has several arguments about why we enjoy art."

Strong: "Pinker argues that humans enjoy visual art because it exploits neural circuits that evolved to help us identify and categorize objects in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness."

##### :x How to make this distinction

When providing your own examples:

- "For instance, consider..." (your example)
- "To illustrate this, imagine..." (your example)
- "Pinker uses the example of..." (his example)

Never leave ambiguity about whether an example comes from you or Pinker.
