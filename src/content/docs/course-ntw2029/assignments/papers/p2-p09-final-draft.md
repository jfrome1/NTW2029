## Purpose

This assignment develops your ability to refine analytical arguments based on targeted feedback and polish academic writing through systematic revision. You'll strengthen skills in evaluating your own analysis, identifying areas for development, and transforming draft insights into finished scholarly work.

## Overview

Write a final 2250-2750 word paper that includes explanation of both positions, analytical thesis about what drives their disagreement, analysis supporting your thesis, and discussion of what understanding this disagreement contributes. Revise based on P08 conference guidance to strengthen specific aspects of your analysis.

## Requirements

Submit a final paper of 2250-2750 words that includes:

**Introduction** that orients readers to the academic conversation, briefly explains what the target argues and what the commentary criticizes, presents your thesis explaining why they reach different conclusions, and previews the significance of your thesis

**Body** explaining both positions and analyzing why they reach different conclusions. Support your thesis with specific textual evidence and reasoning.

**Conclusion** discussing what understanding why they reach different conclusions contributes to the academic conversation

**Reference list** formatted according to the [Citations](/course-ntw2029/resources/citations/#part-2-reference-list) page

**Use at least 4 academic sources:** target article, commentary, author's response (if applicable), and at least 1 additional source

These are the same core requirements as P08, revised and polished based on conference guidance. See [P08](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p08-full-draft-and-outline/) for detailed guidance on introduction structure, explanation and analysis integration, and significance discussion development.

Your revisions will likely focus on:

**Content revisions:**

- Refining or developing your thesis
- Strengthening analysis with deeper insights or additional evidence
- Developing significance discussion to clearly show the impact of your conclusions

**Writing revisions:**

- Revising paragraphs and topic sentences to each convey one main idea
- Restructuring sentences for optimal flow (X does Y, old then new)
- Reducing wordiness (Paramedic method, delete empty phrases)
- Improving paragraph transitions
- Using quotations as evidence for your claims and for credibility

**Polishing revisions:**

- Checking in-text and reference list citations
- Ensuring consistency in key terms
- Using simple language where possible, nuanced language where needed
- Verifying formatting and assignment requirements

## Assessment

Papers are assessed holistically based on the following elements:

**Understanding** - How accurate is the explanation of the target and commentary articles?

**Analysis** - How well-reasoned and well-supported (with quotations and other evidence) is the discussion of what drives the disagreement (e.g. assumptions, definitions, methodological commitments)?

**Significance** - How well does your discussion reveal why understanding this disagreement matters?

**Clarity** - How much mental effort would it take your target audience to read and understand your paper?

**Polish** - How well does your paper meet standards of academic writing and citation?

## Guidelines

### Remember the Process

Your thesis should emerge from your analysis, not motivate it. You've spent P04-P08 building understanding, developing analytical insights, and determining significance. P09 brings all this work together in polished form.

### Your Contribution

Your paper should feel like a genuine contribution to understanding this criticism. You're not just reporting what authors say—you're analyzing what drives their disagreement and revealing why that matters.

### Understanding Performance Expectations

Your paper is assessed on how well you explain both positions, analyze what drives their disagreement, and discuss what understanding this disagreement contributes to the academic conversation.

**Build your foundation first.** Establishing what positions actually claim prepares you to analyze what drives their differences. Understanding what drives differences prepares you to examine consequences. Jumping to implications before establishing what drives disagreement typically produces weak analysis.

**Accurate understanding** of both positions is the foundation. You need to explain what each position claims, using specific textual evidence. If you struggle to explain what the target and commentary actually say—in your own words, with evidence—focus on comprehension before attempting to analyze their disagreement.

**Analytical depth** comes from answering the question: what drives this disagreement?

Foundational analysis identifies where they explicitly disagree—you show that the disagreement exists and explain what each side claims.

Strong analysis examines what drives the disagreement. You might identify underlying assumptions each position relies on, show how different definitions lead to different conclusions, or reveal how methodological commitments constrain what each position can claim. This level analyzes patterns in the disagreement—what structural factors produce different conclusions, whether positions are genuinely incompatible or addressing different questions.

Sophisticated analysis moves beyond identifying what drives disagreement to examining its implications. You might analyze what would resolve the disagreement, what theoretical goals make different approaches useful, what's gained and lost with each framework, or why methodological differences matter for the field.

**Significance discussion** should reveal why understanding this disagreement matters—what's at stake, what becomes possible or impossible depending on how it's resolved, or what your analysis shows about different approaches to the phenomenon.

**Clear writing** means each paragraph conveys one main idea, sentences flow logically, evidence supports claims, and the overall argument develops coherently.

**Polish** means meeting standards of academic writing and citation—accurate quotations, proper citations, consistency in key terms, and attention to sentence-level clarity. Finish your main writing in time to review your draft for:

- Smooth transitions between ideas
- Accurate quotations with proper citations
- Grammatical sentences and paragraphs

## Feedback

I'll provide a grade and written or recorded feedback on your final paper. Your grade will be based on how the assessment questions and the depth and sophistication of your analysis.
