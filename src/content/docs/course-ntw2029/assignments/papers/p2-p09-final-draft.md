## Purpose

This assignment develops your ability to refine analytical arguments based on targeted feedback and polish academic writing through systematic revision. You'll strengthen skills in evaluating your own analysis, identifying areas for development, and transforming draft insights into finished scholarly work.

## Overview

Write a final 2250-2750 word paper that includes explanation of both positions, analytical thesis about what drives their disagreement, analysis supporting your thesis, and discussion of what understanding this disagreement contributes. Revise based on P08 conference guidance to strengthen specific aspects of your analysis.

## Requirements

Your final paper must meet all P08 requirements, with improvements based on conference guidance, and revised to reflect class guidance about writing for your target audience. Your content revisions will likely focus on:

- Refining or developing your thesis
- Strengthening analysis with deeper insights or additional evidence
- Developing significance discussion to clearly show the impact of your conclusions on the academic conversation

Your writing revisions will likely focus on:

- Revising paragraphs and topic sentences to each convey one main idea
- Restructuring sentences for optimal flow (X does Y, old then new)
- Reducing wordiness (Paramedic method, delete empty phrases)
- Improving paragraph transitions
- Using quotations as evidence for your claims and for credibility

Your polishing/proofreading revisions will likely focus on checking:

- in-text and reference list citations
- consistency in keyterms
- simple language where possible, nuanced language where needed
- formatting and assignment requirements

### Source Requirements

- Target article
- Commentary article
- Author's response (only if relevant to your analysis)
- At least 1 additional source used appropriately to support your analysis

## Assessment

### Assessment Framework

Your paper is assessed on how well you explain both positions, analyze what drives their disagreement, and discuss what understanding this disagreement contributes to the academic conversation.

**Accurate understanding** of both positions is the foundation. You need to explain what each position claims, using specific textual evidence. If you struggle to explain what the target and commentary actually say—in your own words, with evidence—focus on comprehension before attempting to analyze their disagreement.

**Analytical depth** comes from answering the question: what drives this disagreement?

Foundational analysis identifies where they explicitly disagree—you show that the disagreement exists and explain what each side claims.

Strong analysis examines what drives the disagreement. You might identify underlying assumptions each position relies on, show how different definitions lead to different conclusions, or reveal how methodological commitments constrain what each position can claim. This level analyzes patterns in the disagreement—what structural factors produce different conclusions, whether positions are genuinely incompatible or addressing different questions.

Sophisticated analysis moves beyond identifying what drives disagreement to examining its implications. You might analyze what would resolve the disagreement, what theoretical goals make different approaches useful, what's gained and lost with each framework, or why methodological differences matter for the field.

**Build your foundation first.** Establishing what positions actually claim prepares you to analyze what drives their differences. Understanding what drives differences prepares you to examine consequences. Jumping to implications before establishing what drives disagreement typically produces weak analysis.

**Significance discussion** should reveal why understanding this disagreement matters—what's at stake, what becomes possible or impossible depending on how it's resolved, or what your analysis shows about different approaches to the phenomenon.

**Clear writing** means each paragraph conveys one main idea, sentences flow logically, evidence supports claims, and the overall argument develops coherently.

### Performance Levels

Papers that accurately explain both positions and identify their explicit disagreement meet foundational expectations. Papers that also analyze what drives the disagreement—the assumptions, definitions, or commitments producing different conclusions—demonstrate strong analytical work. Papers that examine implications of the disagreement show sophisticated engagement with the academic conversation.

Strong work typically establishes structural analysis (what drives disagreement) before moving to consequential analysis (what that disagreement reveals). Sophisticated analysis of implications is possible but not required for strong performance.

## Guidelines

### Using Conference Feedback

Focus on the specific guidance you received about strengthening YOUR paper. The conference identified opportunities based on what your P08 draft showed you're capable of doing with your particular articles.

### Polish and Precision

This is your final draft. Review for:

- Clear thesis statement
- Smooth transitions between ideas
- Accurate quotations with proper citations
- Consistent argument throughout
- Proofread sentences and paragraphs

### Your Contribution

Your paper should feel like a genuine contribution to understanding this criticism. You're not just reporting what authors say—you're analyzing what drives their disagreement and revealing why that matters.

### Remember the Process

Your thesis should emerge from your analysis, not motivate it. You've spent P04-P08 building understanding, developing analytical insights, and determining significance. P09 brings all this work together in polished form.

## Feedback

I'll provide a grade and written feedback on your final paper. Your grade will be based on how well you answer the core questions and the depth and sophistication of your analysis.
