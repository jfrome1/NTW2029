## Purpose

This assignment is your opportunity to polish and finalize your paper based on P08 conference guidance. You'll refine your analysis, strengthen your significance discussion, and ensure your paper represents your best work contributing to the academic conversation about your chosen criticism.

## Overview

Write a final 2250-2750 word paper that includes explanation of both positions, analytical thesis about what makes them incompatible, analysis supporting your thesis, and discussion of what your analysis contributes. Revise based on P08 conference guidance to strengthen specific aspects of your analysis.

## Requirements

Your final paper must include:

1. **Explanation of both positions**: Provide enough context for a reader to understand the target article's argument, what the commentary criticizes, and how these positions conflict. Support with specific evidence from texts.

2. **Analytical thesis**: State what makes these positions incompatible. Your thesis should identify assumptions, definitional differences, evidence interpretation, methodological commitments, or theoretical goals that drive the disagreement.

3. **Analysis supporting thesis**: Develop your analytical thesis with evidence and reasoning. Show how specific aspects of each position create incompatibility.

4. **Significance discussion**: Explain what your analysis contributes to the academic conversation. What does understanding this incompatibility reveal? What's at stake? What would resolving it require?

### Source Requirements

- Target article
- Commentary article
- Author's response (if relevant to your analysis)
- At least 2 additional sources used appropriately to support your analysis

## Assessment

**Note:** The percentage breakdown below indicates relative emphasis in assessment and will be reviewed for future iterations. These are not submission requirements but guidance on what aspects of your work receive most attention during evaluation.

All papers are assessed on how well they answer core questions:

### Understanding (30%)
- What does the commentary claim is problematic about the target article?
- What does the target article say or do that the commentary responds to?
- How do these positions conflict?

*You demonstrate stronger performance by: providing accurate explanations with appropriate context, supporting claims with specific evidence, showing clear understanding of both positions*

### Analysis (40%)
- What makes these positions incompatible?
- What assumptions, definitions, or methodological commitments drive different conclusions?

*You demonstrate stronger performance by: identifying sophisticated insights about incompatibility, providing deep analysis with strong supporting evidence, showing nuanced understanding of what drives disagreement*

**Depth is evaluated through the sophistication of your analysis, not as a separate component.** Stronger analysis often addresses questions like: What theoretical goals make different approaches useful? What would it take to resolve this disagreement? What's gained and lost with each position? How do methodological commitments constrain conclusions? Why do these authors approach the problem differently?

### Significance (20%)
- What does your analysis contribute to the academic conversation?
- What's at stake in how this disagreement is resolved?

*You demonstrate stronger performance by: revealing substantive insights about what your analysis shows, connecting your work meaningfully to academic conversation, explaining clearly why understanding this incompatibility matters*

### Clarity & Organization (10%)
- Clear structure, effective transitions, appropriate evidence use, correct citations

## Performance Levels

### Needs Improvement
- Incomplete, inaccurate, or superficial answers to core questions
- Superficial analysis ("they just disagree") or unclear reasoning
- Generic or missing significance discussion
- Organization or clarity problems
- Reliance on appeal to authority rather than student's own analysis

### Meets Basic Requirements
- Clear, accurate answers to core questions with solid supporting analysis
- Appropriate context and evidence
- Substantive significance discussion showing what analysis reveals
- Clear analytical thesis identifying what makes positions incompatible

### Exceeds Basic Requirements (demonstrates ONE OR MORE of the following)
- Sophisticated answers to core questions revealing non-obvious insights
- Particularly deep engagement with what drives incompatibility
- Deep understanding of theoretical frameworks driving positions
- Integration of multiple analytical approaches
- Well-executed evaluation grounded in student's own reasoning (not appeal to authority)
- Especially insightful discussion of what's at stake

**Note:** Developing depth is not about adding separate components. You achieve stronger work through more sophisticated answers to core questions.

## Guidelines

### Using Conference Feedback

Focus on the specific guidance you received about strengthening YOUR paper. The conference identified opportunities based on what your P08 draft showed you're capable of doing with your particular articles.

### Polish and Precision

This is your final draft. Review for:
- Clear thesis statement
- Smooth transitions between ideas
- Accurate quotations with proper citations
- Consistent argument throughout
- Proofread sentences and paragraphs

### Your Contribution

Your paper should feel like a genuine contribution to understanding this criticism. You're not just reporting what authors sayâ€”you're analyzing what makes their positions incompatible and revealing why that matters.

### Remember the Process

Your thesis should emerge from your analysis, not motivate it. You've spent P04-P08 building understanding, developing analytical insights, and determining significance. P09 brings all this work together in polished form.

## Checklist

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist can remind you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it is not a comprehensive summary of all assignment requirements.

- [ ] 2250-2750 words
- [ ] Clear explanation of both positions with sufficient context
- [ ] Analytical thesis stating what makes positions incompatible
- [ ] Analysis supporting thesis with evidence
- [ ] Significance discussion explaining your contribution
- [ ] At least 2 additional sources beyond target, commentary, response
- [ ] All sources used appropriately (support analysis, don't expand scope)
- [ ] Thesis emerges from analysis rather than motivating it
- [ ] Claims supported with evidence and proper citations
- [ ] Paper revised based on P08 conference guidance
- [ ] Proofread for clarity, organization, and correctness

## Feedback

You'll receive a grade and written feedback on your final paper. Your grade will be based on how well you answer the core questions and the depth and sophistication of your analysis, not on which components are present (all papers should include all core components).
