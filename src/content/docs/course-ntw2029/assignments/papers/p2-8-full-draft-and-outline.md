Submit a full draft of your paper (including reference list) and a full outline of your paper. Start the full outline of your paper on a new page. Submit everything as one document.

Highlight the thesis and topic sentences in the draft, but don't highlight anything in the outline.

In the outline, the thesis should be copied verbatim from your paper. The main points in the outline should be copied verbatim from your topic sentences (the subpoints can be paraphrases). This approach will help you check whether your paper's topic sentences capture your argument. If your outline doesn't make sense by itself, revise your topic sentences.

Note: I will focus on your outline when writing my feedback, as the argument is the most important aspect of your paper.

<!-- next time:

- make clear the thesis and main outline points should be directly from the paper, maybe exclude the subpoints?
- could do just topic sentences but arranged into hierarchy
- add examples of good outlines
- maybe 2 parts: topic sentence and purpose of paragraph? but isn't that redundant, wouldn't the purpose just be to convey a claim?
- need to add something making clear that you don't explain the source and go through the arguments just to do it, but only when needed for the thesis. Can use planning/p2-8 outline problem as an example.
- put word count limit on outline?
- want to add video or resource showing how to work back and forth between an outline and document
- for outline formats, specify limited number of subpoints



## Assignment purpose

Write a complete draft and outline of Paper 2 to receive feedback before the final paper is due.

## Logistics

- This assignment has two parts: a full draft of Paper 2 and on outline of Paper 2, which is a bit different than previous outlines in this course (described below).
- There is no word count requirement for this assignment, but be mindful of the word count of 2250-2750 for the final paper. There is no word count requirement for the outline.
- The paper should have a reference list including 4 or more sources, but don't include the reference list in the word count.
- On the reference list, only include sources actually cited in the paper with in-text citations.
- Highlight your thesis in yellow (2 sentences max).
- Highlight the topic sentence in each body paragraph in light blue
	- the introduction will not have a highlighted topic sentence
	- max one topic sentence per paragraph
	- topic sentences are almost always the first or second sentence in the paragraph
- Feedback questions: on your draft and/or outline, please use the Word "comment" feature to ask me up to 10 questions. I will prioritize answering those questions in my feedback.

## Guidelines

- Re-read the Paper 2 overview page and make sure you understand the goals and structure of the expected paper. Ask if you have any questions. Carefully follow the paper formatting guidelines.
- The full draft should be as complete as possible, including a properly formatted reference list, word count, and GenAI link/statement.
- The outline will be slightly different from previous outlines in that you will use your actual topic sentences from the draft as your points and subpoints:
	- your points and subpoints in the outline should be the exact topic sentences from the paragraphs in your draft, and all paragraphs should be represented in the outline
	- this guideline means that your outline will have the same number of points as you have paragraphs in the draft
	- if you copy your topic sentences into the outline, and the outline doesn't make sense when you do it this way, it is ok to write the points in different words and then follow each one with a quoted topic sentence from your paper draft (but the basic content of each point should match the topic sentence)
	- work back and forth between the outline and the draft, checking that:
		- all subpoints support their main points, and that the main points all support the thesis
		- there are no subpoints outside the scope of their main point and no main points outside the scope of the thesis
		- points are fully supported by their subpoints (i.e. no part of  claim is not supported) and the thesis is fully supported by the main points
	- if you have trouble making the outline and draft work together in this way, just do your best and include a note explaining why you had trouble working with this guideline (to help me improve the assignment in the future).

### Content checklist:

- does your introduction clarify 1) the academic conversation, 2) what your source argues to contribute to that conversation, and 3) what you say in response to the source that also contributes to that conversation?
- is your thesis (2 sentences max) highlighted in yellow?
- is your thesis an argumentative claim rather than a description of what you intend to do in the paper?
- are your topic sentences highlighted in light blue?
- is every paragraph about just one main idea? Is that idea fully captured in the topic sentence? (this means that paragraphs shouldn't have sentences that are outside the scope of the topic sentence)
- does your analysis really relate to source arguments that are central to the phenomenon they aim to explain, rather than side points that don't have significant implications for understanding that phenomenon? (in other words, are you talking about something that is significant to the overall argument? if your source agreed with your comments, would they have to change their conclusions in any way?)
- do you relate your analysis and claims to the relevant academic conversation?
- do you consider counterexamples or objections and include them where appropriate?
- did you check for the most important writing issues from Paper 1 and make sure your draft addresses those issues?

## Submission

- Submit both parts of this assignment on Canvas as one document. The outline should come after the reference list and should start on a new page.
- Please follow paper guidelines, include a GenAI link or non-use statement, and submit an updated workload report under Exercise 10.

After this conference, you can email me short questions that I can quickly answer. You can also request an in-person meeting and I'll do my best to accommodate you. Unfortunately, I am not able to provide feedback on emailed drafts or paper sections outside of submitted assignments. -->
