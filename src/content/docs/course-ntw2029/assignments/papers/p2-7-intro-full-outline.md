Details to come, but in short, you will:

- write a draft of the first part your paper, including the introduction and the first body paragraphs that explain your source argument to the reader
- write a full outline of your paper

<!-- ## Assignment purpose

This assignment is intended to help you make progress on writing Paper 2 in ways that will let you get the most out of peer feedback during week 12. You will draft the beginning of Paper 2, write an outline for the entirety of Paper 2, and summarize the most important writing feedback you got on Paper 1 (although you won't share this last part with your classmates).

Note: I will read these assignments to keep up with your progress and so I can better help you during class peer review, but I will not be able to provide individual feedback on this assignment. I will provide individual video feedback on the full drafts submitted for the next assignment.

## Logistics

Submit the assignment described below as an attached Word document.
There is no word count requirement for this assignment. Use your best judgement.
This assignment includes three parts, described below:

1. draft of the first section of Paper 2
2. full outline of Paper 2
3. summarize top three points of writing feedback

## Guidelines

First, re-read the Paper 2 overview page and make sure you understand the goals and structure of the expected paper. Ask if you have any questions.

### Part 1: write a draft of the first part of Paper 2

This partial draft should be in normal essay format, using full sentences and paragraphs. It will include:

- the paper introduction, which should cover:
	- orienting the reader to the topic
	- introduction to the academic conversation
	- a very brief summary of your source's contribution to the academic conversation
	- very brief summary of the specific part of the source argument you intend to analyze
	- your thesis, which will make a claim about that specific part of the source argument
		- You may not be ready to identify a final thesis you can defend; that's fine, put in a guess as to what your thesis might be.
		- Check that your thesis and the source argument both contribute to the same academic conversation. The source will make many claims that do not really affect their main argument. Disputing those claims does not significantly contribute to the academic conversation.
			- Check that your thesis is an argumentative claim rather than a description of what you intend to do in the paper.
			- Check that your thesis is a claim evaluating your source argument rather than your own theory about a better way to answer the source's research question (it is ok for your thesis to also correct/extend the source argument in a limited way by making a small change or improvement to the theory, but your addition/change should not be a standalone theory explaining the phenomenon in question).
- the first body paragraphs of your paper that explain the source argument to your generalist reader, which should cover:
	- an overview of the source argument as a whole
	- an explanation of the specific section of the source argument you will be analyzing
	- Note: the amount of time you devote to explaining the general vs. specific parts of the source argument will depend on your specific source and your own paper's claims and strategy.
	- Note: remember, this sort of explanation includes both summary (where you express key points in fewer words than the source) and explication (where you explain key points using more words than the source, introducing information in an "old then new" structure, walking your reader step-by-step through the concept to make sure they can understand the logical connection between ideas)

For the 1st half of this assignment, highlight your thesis in yellow (2 sentences max) and highlight the topic sentence of each body paragraph in light blue (should be 1-2 consecutive sentences max at/near the top of the paragraph)

### Part 2: write a proposed/draft outline

Follow the source summary outline assignment guidelines for this part (just in terms of formatting and using full sentences, not the content to be included in the outline). In addition to covering the draft of the first half of the paper, the outline may cover topics such as the following, organized as you see fit (these are possibilities; you don't have to include all of the following):

- your analysis of areas where the source argument has gaps, ambiguities, limitations, poor evidence, unsupported assumptions, elisions (areas the source should discuss but skip over), etc. relevant to the academic conversation
	- Important: do not list a bunch of loosely-related criticisms of the source; your analysis should focus on a few specific points that support a single, unified thesis claim
- the implications of these improvable aspects of the source argument
- any corrections or changes you suggest
- how your analysis might add to a generalist readers' understanding of the academic conversation
- possible counterexamples or objections

Note: you do not need to highlight anything for the 2nd half of the assignment.
Note: the outline doesn't need to include a conclusion

### Part 3: writing feedback check

Review your Paper 1 feedback. What was the most important feedback you received about sentence and paragraph writing in paper 1? Ignore any comments I made about the specific content of the paper. I mean things about thesis structure/specificity, paragraph and sentence structure, grammar, and punctuation.
List the most important issues mentioned, up to a maximum of three. Make sure to keep these in mind when proofreading Part 1 of this assignment.

### Content checklist:

- does your introduction clarify 1) the academic conversation, 2) what your source argues to contribute to that conversation, and 3) what you say in response to the source that also contributes to that conversation?
- is your thesis (2 sentences max) highlighted?
- is your thesis an argumentative claim rather than a description of what you intend to do in the paper?
- are your topic sentences highlighted?
- is every paragraph about just one main idea? Is that idea fully captured in the topic sentence? (this means that paragraphs shouldn't have sentences that are outside the scope of the topic sentence)
- does your analysis really relate to source arguments that are central to the phenomenon they aim to explain, rather than side points that don't have significant implications for understanding that phenomenon? (in other words, are you talking about something that is significant to the overall argument? if your source agreed with your comments, would they have to change their conclusions in any way?)
- do you relate your analysis and claims to the relevant academic conversation?
- do you consider counterexamples or objections and include them where appropriate?
- did you check for the most important writing issues from Paper 1 and make sure your partial essay draft addresses those issues?
