title: P06 - Verify Positions
date: 2026-01-10
---

## Purpose

This assignment develops your ability to verify whether a commentary accurately represents its target before building analysis on that foundation. By explicitly checking qualifiers, scope, and characterizations, you'll catch misreadings that would otherwise undermine your paper.

## Overview

Restate the disagreement between target and commentary, then verify whether the commentary accurately represents the target's position. Finally, articulate why these positions are incompatible. This is detailed verification work—you're checking accuracy, not yet developing your thesis about what underlies the disagreement.

## Requirements

Complete all five parts below. Use your P05 work as raw material.

### Part A: Restate the Disagreement

Provide a brief restatement of the criticism and response so your verification work has clear context.

**A1. What does the commentary criticize?**

In 2-3 sentences, summarize the main criticism the commentary makes of the target. This should be a concise version of what you gathered in P05.

**A2. How does the target respond?** [:How do I find the author's response?](#x-how-do-i-find-the-authors-response)

If the target authors address this criticism in their response:
- Summarize their response in 2-3 sentences
- Quote the key passage (with page number)

If the target authors do not address this criticism:
- State that they don't address it
- Write 2-3 sentences describing how you think the target authors *might* respond, based on their article. What would they likely say if asked about this criticism?

---

### Part B: Qualifier and Scope Analysis

Examine the target's claims about the topic the commentary criticizes.

**B1. What qualifiers does the target use?**

Quote 2-3 passages where the target discusses the criticized topic. For each passage, identify any qualifying language:

- Modal verbs: must, can, may, might, could, should
- Frequency terms: always, usually, typically, sometimes, rarely, never
- Scope markers: all, most, many, some, certain, particular

List the qualifiers you found and explain what they suggest about how strong or limited the target's claim is.

**B2. What scope does the target claim?**

Based on your analysis, describe the scope of the target's claim:

- Does the target claim this is true in all cases, typical cases, or only some cases?
- Does the target identify exceptions or boundary conditions?
- How broad or narrow is what the target claims to explain?

**B3. Does the commentary preserve these qualifiers and scope?**

Compare the target's actual language (from B1) to how the commentary characterizes the target's position (from your P05 Q2).

- Does the commentary preserve the target's qualifiers?
- Does the commentary accurately represent the target's scope?
- Does the commentary strengthen, weaken, or change the target's claim?

### Part C: Verification (Room Test)

Use the room test to verify whether the target and commentary genuinely disagree about what the target claims.

**C1. Quote comparison**

Side by side, provide:

- What the TARGET actually says (quote with page number)
- How the COMMENTARY characterizes the target's position (quote with page number)

**C2. Room test**

Imagine the target authors and commentary authors in a room together. The commentary says "You claim X."

Would the target respond:

- "Yes, we do claim X" (accurate characterization)
- "No, we actually claim Y" (mischaracterization)
- "Sort of—we don't say 'always X', we say 'X in certain contexts'" (over-reading)

Explain which response fits and why, based on your textual evidence.

**C3. Author's response analysis**

If the target authors responded to this criticism (from Part A2), analyze whether their response supports or complicates your verification finding.

If they didn't respond, explain whether your hypothetical response (from A2) aligns with what your verification suggests.

**C4. Verification finding**

State your finding:

- **Match:** Commentary accurately represents target's position
- **Over-reading:** Commentary strengthens target's claim beyond what target states
- **Mischaracterization:** Commentary attributes claims the target doesn't make
- **Other:** Describe the discrepancy

Explain the finding with specific textual evidence.

### Part D: Incompatibility Articulation

Given your verification findings, explain why these positions cannot both be true.

**If you found a match (genuine disagreement):**

Explain the logical conflict. Why can't both positions be correct? What would have to be true for one position that would make the other false?

**If you found over-reading or mischaracterization:**

First, explain what the apparent disagreement was (based on commentary's characterization).

Then explain what the actual relationship between positions is:

- Is there still a genuine disagreement, just about something different than it first appeared?
- Are the positions actually compatible once qualifiers are restored?
- Is the commentary criticizing something the target doesn't actually claim?

Even if the commentary over-reads, there may still be a real disagreement underneath—just not exactly where the commentary locates it.

---

### Part E: Criticism Significance

Explain what's at stake for the target's argument.

**If the commentary's criticism is correct, what would that mean for the target's argument?**

Consider:

- Would the target need to narrow their claims?
- Would their explanation be incomplete or inadequate?
- Would their main contribution be undermined?
- Would they need to revise their theory, or just clarify it?

This is not about who's right—it's about understanding why this criticism matters. If the criticism wouldn't significantly affect the target's argument even if correct, that's worth noting (and may suggest you should focus on a different criticism).

## Guidelines

### Using Your P05 Work

Your P05 submission provides raw material:

- Q1-3 give your understanding of the criticism
- Q4-5 show the target passages and what you think they mean
- Q6 shows the commentary's reasoning
- Q7 provides the author's response (if any)

P06 asks you to analyze this material more carefully—checking qualifiers, applying the room test, and determining what kind of disagreement (if any) actually exists.

### What Makes This Different from P05

P05 asked: What does each article say?

P06 asks: Does the commentary accurately represent what the target says?

This is a different question. You're not just understanding each position—you're comparing characterizations to originals and checking for accuracy.

### Common Verification Findings

**Over-reading** is the most common issue. Signs include:

- Commentary uses "always" or "necessary" when target uses "typically" or "distinctive"
- Commentary treats one mechanism as the target's complete explanation when target mentions multiple factors
- Commentary ignores qualifications the target explicitly states

**Genuine disagreement** also occurs. Signs include:

- Target and commentary make incompatible claims about the same phenomenon
- Both acknowledge what the other claims and explicitly reject it
- Author's response engages with the substance of the criticism

### Incompatibility vs. Thesis

Part D asks you to explain why positions are incompatible. This is NOT your thesis.

- Incompatibility = the logical conflict (why can't both be true?)
- Thesis = what underlies or explains that conflict (coming in P07)

For example:

- Incompatibility: "If the target is right that X causes Y, the commentary's evidence that Z causes Y would suggest the target's mechanism is incomplete. If the commentary is right, the target's scope is too narrow."
- Thesis (P07): "This disagreement stems from different assumptions about what counts as sufficient evidence for causal claims."

### Preparing for Conference

Come to conference ready to:

- Explain your verification finding with specific evidence
- Discuss whether over-reading changes what the disagreement is really about
- Identify any remaining uncertainties about what either article claims

## Feedback

You'll discuss your verification findings in conference. Come prepared to explain your evidence and reasoning.

##### :x How do I find the author's response?

To find passages relevant to your specific commentary: (1) Open the file with the target and commentary articles, (2) Search (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) for your commentary author's last name, (3) Read any passages in the author's response where they cite or discuss your commentary.
