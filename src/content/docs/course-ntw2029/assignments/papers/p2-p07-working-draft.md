## Purpose

This assignment helps you develop a thesis explaining why the target and commentary reach different conclusions. You'll practice explaining the logical conflict in their stated positions, which is different from evaluating which position is stronger. This draft will receive peer review before you expand it in P08.

## Overview

Write a 1200-1500 word draft that includes explanation of both positions, a thesis explaining why they reach different conclusions, and analysis supporting your thesis. You'll also identify sources you'll use in P08 and briefly discuss why your thesis matters.

## Requirements

Your draft must include:

1. **Explanation of both positions**: Provide whatever explanation enables your reader to understand what the target argues, what the commentary challenges about it, and how these positions conflict. Depending on your specific articles, this might emphasize overall arguments, specific claims, or implicit assumptions—whatever your analysis requires.

2. **Thesis explaining the disagreement**: State why the target and commentary reach different conclusions, then include 1-2 sentences explaining specific consequences of this disagreement for the research conversation. Your thesis should answer: What prevents these positions from both being right, and what specific research question becomes difficult or unresolvable because of this?

   Don't argue that one scholar is right and the other is wrong. Instead, explain how their different starting points (definitions, methods, assumptions) lead to different conclusions, and describe concrete consequences of those differences.

3. **Analysis supporting your thesis**: Develop your thesis with specific evidence and reasoning. This might involve identifying unstated assumptions, explaining how definitional differences shape conclusions, analyzing how evidence is interpreted differently, or showing how methodological commitments lead to different conclusions.

4. **Source identification**: List at least 2 additional sources beyond target, commentary, and response (if relevant) that you'll use in P08. For each source, provide 1-2 sentences explaining how it will support your analysis.

### What Your Thesis Should Do

Your thesis should explain WHY the positions reach different conclusions, not evaluate which position is stronger.

**Appropriate thesis examples** (for P07):
- "The disagreement stems from incompatible definitions of emotional engagement that lead to different predictions. Understanding this definitional conflict reveals that both authors may be correct within their respective frameworks."
- "The target and commentary focus on different types of causation—sufficient versus necessary conditions—which makes their claims about cooperation incommensurable. This matters because it suggests the debate requires clarifying causal questions before evaluating evidence."
- "The commentary challenges the target's empirical claims, but close examination reveals they're measuring different phenomena. Recognizing this distinction helps explain why seemingly contradictory findings can coexist."

**Inappropriate thesis examples** (NOT for P07):
- "The commentary's objection fails because..." (picking a side)
- "The commentary provides stronger evidence than the target" (judging)
- "The target's theory better explains the data" (evaluating)

Save evaluative claims for P08-P09, and only if your analysis supports them.

### What Counts as Concrete Significance

Your significance statement must show one specific consequence that connects directly to the difference you identified. Good significance:
- Names what becomes difficult, unclear, or unresolvable
- Connects to specific research questions or methodological choices
- Shows trade-offs or constraints revealed by the disagreement

Not acceptable:
- Generic statements ("this is important," "more research needed")
- Moralizing ("shows need for clarity")
- Restating that disagreement exists

### Diagnostic Questions for Understanding the Disagreement

To identify why the positions reach different conclusions, answer whichever questions apply to your case. Most commentaries will match one or two patterns—you don't need to answer questions that don't fit your disagreement:

**Pattern 1: Claims don't match evidence**
- Does the commentary show the target's prediction failed?
- Are there counterexamples to the target's universal claim?
- Does the target cherry-pick supporting cases while ignoring contradictory evidence?
- *Example: Verpooten & Eens show singing doesn't correlate with social complexity as predicted*

**Pattern 2: Missing important factors**
- What does the commentary say the target overlooked?
- Why does that missing factor matter for understanding the phenomenon?
- *Example: Goldstein shows theatre lacks representational distance that target's theory requires*

**Pattern 3: Definitions don't match**
- Do target and commentary define key terms differently?
- If you used the commentary's definition, would the disagreement dissolve or remain?
- *Example: Norman redefines "exploration" to include all non-real worlds, not just fantastical ones*

**Pattern 4: Wrong question or framework**
- Does the commentary say the target asked the wrong question?
- Does the commentary claim the target's approach can't work for this type of phenomenon?
- *Example: Killin argues adaptation/byproduct framework can't handle coevolved mosaics like music*

**Pattern 5: Logical problems or scientific standards**
- Does the commentary say the target's argument is circular or logically invalid?
- Does the commentary say the theory is too vague to test or makes no testable predictions?
- Does the commentary challenge what evidence threshold is needed (burden of proof, parsimony, defaults)?
- *Example: Stewart-Williams argues evidence is ambiguous between adaptation and byproduct; when evidence doesn't discriminate, default should be simpler explanation*

Answering the relevant questions will help you understand what drives the disagreement. Your analysis should explain how these issues prevent the authors from reaching compatible conclusions.

### About Depth

The analytical work described above is required for all papers—it's not optional or advanced. What distinguishes stronger papers is the depth and sophistication of this analysis, not its presence. Depth comes from how thoroughly you identify what drives the disagreement and how well you support your claims with evidence.

## Guidelines

### Developing Your Thesis

Your thesis should emerge from your understanding of both positions. After P06, you understand what each argues. Now ask: What prevents these positions from both being right? What assumptions, definitions, or commitments lead these authors to different conclusions?

The diagnostic questions above can help structure this inquiry. Once you've answered the relevant questions for your case, your thesis should articulate what you've discovered about the nature of the disagreement.

The 1-2 sentences about significance should flow naturally from your claim. If you've identified what prevents the positions from both being right, you can explain why that matters—what it reveals about the criticism, what it suggests for future research, or what it clarifies about the disagreement.

### If You Find Yourself Wanting to Argue Which Side Is Right

It's natural to form judgments about which position seems stronger. Hold that thought for P08. For P07, focus first on why they reach different conclusions—what assumptions, definitions, or evidence interpretations drive their disagreement. If showing consequences of those differences leads you to reveal limitations, that can emerge in P08-09, but frame it as explanation of consequences rather than advocacy.

### Using Your P06 Work

Use your P06 explanation to provide context, but adapt it to serve your analysis. Your reader needs to understand the disagreement well enough to follow your claims. This might require emphasizing different aspects than P06 did, depending on where your analysis has led you.

### Related Arguments

You focused on one main criticism in P04-P06. In P07, you may discuss related arguments from the commentary if they strengthen your analysis of why the positions reach different conclusions. However, maintain focus on your central question.

### Preparing for Additional Sources

During P07, identify the additional sources you'll need for P08:

- If the commentary cites research as evidence for its claims, find and begin reading that research to evaluate whether it supports what the commentary says
- If the commentary or author's response references other work by either author, locate those sources to see whether they clarify or complicate the criticism
- If you need to understand theoretical frameworks or technical concepts mentioned in either article, find sources that explain them

List these sources in your P07 submission with brief explanation of how each will support your analysis. Remember: Additional sources should help you evaluate THIS specific criticism. They should not introduce entirely new arguments or shift focus away from the disagreement between your target and commentary.

### Remember the Process

Your thesis should be the RESULT of your analysis of what you've learned about both positions. In P08, you may develop evaluative claims if your analysis supports them, but P07 focuses on understanding what drives the disagreement.

## Peer Review Focus

During peer review, you'll:

- Explain to peers what the commentary's criticism is about
- Get feedback on what's still unclear in your explanation
- Discuss how you understand why they reach different conclusions
- Explore possible ways to evaluate the arguments (for P08)

Your peers will help you think through:
- What's still unclear about either position?
- What do they think prevents these positions from both being right?
- What would someone need to know to evaluate these positions?
- What assumptions might be driving the disagreement?

## Checklist

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist can remind you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it is not a comprehensive summary of all assignment requirements.

- [ ] Maintains focus on one main criticism with any related arguments supporting analysis
- [ ] No evaluative claims about which position is stronger (save for P08)
- [ ] Lists at least 2 additional sources with brief justification for each

## Feedback

You will not receive instructor feedback on P07. Instead, you'll get peer review to help you clarify your thinking before expanding your draft in P08. Use the peer review session to test whether your explanation is clear and to explore options with your peers.
