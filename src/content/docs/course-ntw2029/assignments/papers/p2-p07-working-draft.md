## Purpose

This assignment helps you develop a working thesis (not your final thesis) explaining why the target and commentary reach different conclusions. You'll practice explaining the logical conflict in their stated positions, which is different from evaluating which position is stronger. This draft will receive peer review before you develop it into a full draft in P08.

## Overview

Write a working draft of up to 1500 words. P07 should minimally include an introduction, explanation of both positions, a working thesis explaining why they reach different conclusions, analysis supporting your thesis, and identification of additional sources for P08. If you are confident that you have covered these aspects sufficiently, you are welcome to continue developing other parts of your paper, such as deepening your analysis or beginning to think about what your analysis reveals for the academic conversation. Peer review will focus on the required elements before moving to the optional elements.

## Requirements


### Required Elements

Your draft must include:

1. **Introduction**: Provide context for the disagreement you're analyzing. What question or issue do the target and commentary address? What's the commentary's main criticism? Your introduction should orient readers to the academic conversation.

2. **Explanation of both positions**: Provide whatever explanation enables your reader to understand what the target argues, what the commentary challenges about it, and how these positions conflict. Depending on your specific articles, this might emphasize overall arguments, specific claims, or implicit assumptions—whatever your analysis requires.

3. **Working thesis**: State why the target and commentary reach different conclusions. Your thesis should answer: What prevents these positions from both being right?

   Don't argue that one scholar is right and the other is wrong. Instead, explain how their different starting points (definitions, methods, assumptions) lead to different conclusions.

   **Expect your thesis to change.** What you develop in P07 is a working thesis that will likely be refined, deepened, or even reconceived as you work through P08. Starting with a surface-level observation and developing it through analysis is normal and expected.

4. **Analysis supporting your thesis**: Develop your thesis with specific evidence and reasoning. This might involve identifying unstated assumptions, explaining how definitional differences shape conclusions, analyzing how evidence is interpreted differently, or showing how methodological commitments lead to different conclusions.

5. **Source identification**: List at least 2 additional sources beyond target, commentary, and response (if relevant) that you'll use in P08. For each source, provide 1-2 sentences explaining how it will support your analysis.

### Optional Development

If you have adequately covered the required elements, you may continue developing:

- Deeper analysis using the diagnostic questions
- More thorough engagement with additional sources you've identified
- Initial thinking about why understanding this disagreement matters for the academic conversation (you'll develop this fully in P08)

Peer review will help you determine whether the required elements need more development or whether you're ready to expand into these optional areas.

### How Working Theses Develop

Your thesis will likely evolve through stages. This is expected, not a sign of problems.

**Starting observation** (not yet a thesis):

- "They disagree about whether X is an adaptation"
- This restates the conclusion-level disagreement. It identifies where they differ but not why.

**Working thesis** (meets P07 requirement):

- "They disagree because the target focuses on evolutionary history while the commentary focuses on current function"
- "They use different standards for what counts as evidence—the target accepts correlational studies but the commentary requires experimental manipulation"
- "The target treats X as a necessary mechanism while the commentary argues it's one option among several"

These identify what drives the disagreement. They may be surface-level explanations that you'll deepen in P08, but they move beyond just noting that disagreement exists.

**Deeper thesis** (develops in P08):

- Shows how the difference produces logical incompatibility
- Identifies implicit assumptions or commitments neither author states
- Reveals structural constraints in frameworks
- Explains patterns in how evidence gets interpreted

Peer review will help you identify whether you're still at the starting observation (need to develop a working thesis) or have a working thesis that explains the disagreement (ready to deepen in P08).

### Beginning to Think About Significance

As you develop your working thesis, start considering: Why does understanding this disagreement matter? What does it reveal about this criticism or this research area? You won't write a full significance discussion in P07, but beginning to think about these questions will help you in P08:

- What becomes difficult or unresolvable because of this disagreement?
- What does the disagreement reveal about different approaches to studying this phenomenon?
- If this disagreement were resolved, what would that require or enable?

### Diagnostic Questions for Understanding the Disagreement

To identify why the positions reach different conclusions, answer whichever questions apply to your case. Most commentaries will match one or two patterns—you don't need to answer questions that don't fit your disagreement:

**Pattern 1: Claims don't match evidence**

- Does the commentary show the target's prediction failed?
- Are there counterexamples to the target's universal claim?
- Does the target cherry-pick supporting cases while ignoring contradictory evidence?
- *Example: Verpooten & Eens show singing doesn't correlate with social complexity as predicted*

**Pattern 2: Missing important factors**

- What does the commentary say the target overlooked?
- Why does that missing factor matter for understanding the phenomenon?
- *Example: Goldstein shows theatre lacks representational distance that target's theory requires*

**Pattern 3: Definitions don't match**

- Do target and commentary define key terms differently?
- If you used the commentary's definition, would the disagreement dissolve or remain?
- *Example: Norman redefines "exploration" to include all non-real worlds, not just fantastical ones*

**Pattern 4: Wrong question or framework**

- Does the commentary say the target asked the wrong question?
- Does the commentary claim the target's approach can't work for this type of phenomenon?
- *Example: Killin argues adaptation/byproduct framework can't handle coevolved mosaics like music*

**Pattern 5: Logical problems or scientific standards**

- Does the commentary say the target's argument is circular or logically invalid?
- Does the commentary say the theory is too vague to test or makes no testable predictions?
- Does the commentary challenge what evidence threshold is needed (burden of proof, parsimony, defaults)?
- *Example: Stewart-Williams argues evidence is ambiguous between adaptation and byproduct; when evidence doesn't discriminate, default should be simpler explanation*

Answering the relevant questions will help you understand what drives the disagreement. Your analysis should explain how these issues prevent the authors from reaching compatible conclusions.

### About Depth

The analytical work described above is required for all papers—it's not optional or advanced. What distinguishes stronger papers is the depth and sophistication of this analysis, not its presence.

Depth often comes from getting below the surface to understand what implicit issues the disagreement reflects. This doesn't mean being clever for its own sake. It means:

- Identifying assumptions or commitments that aren't explicitly stated but drive the disagreement
- Examining details in cited research to understand why the authors disagree about what evidence shows
- Recognizing structural features of their approaches that explain why the disagreement persists
- Revealing patterns that neither author explicitly names

This kind of depth emerges from thorough analytical work, not from trying to sound sophisticated.

## Guidelines

### Developing Your Working Thesis

Your thesis should emerge from your understanding of both positions. After P06, you understand what each argues. Now ask: What prevents these positions from both being right? What assumptions, definitions, or commitments lead these authors to different conclusions?

The diagnostic questions above can help structure this inquiry. Once you've answered the relevant questions for your case, your thesis should articulate what you've discovered about the nature of the disagreement.

Don't worry if your thesis seems straightforward or surface-level at this stage. The goal is to move beyond "they disagree about X" to "they disagree because of Y." You'll deepen this understanding in P08.

### If You Find Yourself Wanting to Argue Which Side Is Right

It's natural to form judgments about which position seems stronger. Hold that thought for P08. For P07, focus first on why they reach different conclusions—what assumptions, definitions, or evidence interpretations drive their disagreement. If showing consequences of those differences leads you to reveal limitations, that can emerge in P08-09, but frame it as explanation of consequences rather than advocacy.

### Using Your P06 Work

Use your P06 explanation to provide context, but adapt it to serve your analysis. Your reader needs to understand the disagreement well enough to follow your claims. This might require emphasizing different aspects than P06 did, depending on where your analysis has led you.

### Related Arguments

You focused on one main criticism in P04-P06. In P07, you may discuss related arguments from the commentary if they strengthen your analysis of why the positions reach different conclusions. However, maintain focus on your central question.

### Preparing for Additional Sources

During P07, identify the additional sources you'll need for P08:

- If the commentary cites research as evidence for its claims, find and begin reading that research to evaluate whether it supports what the commentary says
- If the commentary or author's response references other work by either author, locate those sources to see whether they clarify or complicate the criticism
- If you need to understand theoretical frameworks or technical concepts mentioned in either article, find sources that explain them

List these sources in your P07 submission with brief explanation of how each will support your analysis. Remember: Additional sources should help you evaluate THIS specific criticism. They should not introduce entirely new arguments or shift focus away from the disagreement between your target and commentary.

### Remember the Process

Your working thesis should be the RESULT of your analysis of what you've learned about both positions. Expect it to evolve as you work through P08. In P08, you'll develop your significance discussion and may deepen your thesis, but P07 focuses on establishing your baseline understanding of what drives the disagreement.

## Peer Review Focus

During peer review, you'll:

- Explain to peers what the commentary's criticism is about
- Get feedback on what's still unclear in your explanation
- Discuss how you understand why they reach different conclusions
- Explore possible ways to evaluate the arguments (for P08)

Your peers will help you think through:

- What's still unclear about either position?
- What do they think prevents these positions from both being right?
- What would someone need to know to evaluate these positions?
- What assumptions might be driving the disagreement?

## Feedback

You will not receive instructor feedback on P07. Instead, you'll get peer review to help you clarify your thinking before developing your draft into P08. Use the peer review session to test whether your explanation is clear and to explore options with your peers.
