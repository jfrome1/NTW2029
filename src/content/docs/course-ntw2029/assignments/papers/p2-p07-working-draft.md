title: "P07 - Working Draft"
date: 2025-10-28
---

## Purpose

This assignment helps you develop a working thesis (not your final thesis) explaining why the target and commentary reach different conclusions. You'll practice explaining the logical conflict in their stated positions, which is different from evaluating which position is stronger. This draft will receive peer review before you develop it into a full draft in P08.

## Overview

Write a "working draft" in the form of separate paragraphs (up to 1750 total) that you will later combine in your full draft. You will verify whether your target and commentary genuinely disagree, then then explain what drives the disagreement (or what caused the apparent disagreement if it dissolves under verification).

## Requirements

Copy and paste the below headers (keep numbering) into a document, writing your paragraphs under each heading. You can have more than one paragraph per heading if needed:

### 1. Explanation of Both Positions

Explain what the target argues and what the commentary challenges. [:How to explain positions](#x-how-to-explain-positions)

### 2. Verification of Disagreement

Document your verification of whether the articles agree or disagree, in their explicit claims, about the target article's position. [:How to verify disagreement](#x-how-to-verify-disagreement)

### 3. Working Thesis

State what your verification revealed about what prevents these positions from being compatible. [:How to formulate your working thesis](#x-how-to-formulate-your-thesis)

### 4. Continuing Analysis

Do the analysis necessary to develop (deepen) your thesis by looking for patterns in the target/commentary disagreement that suggest follow-up questions. [:How to develop your analysis](#x-how-to-develop-your-analysis)

### 5. Source Identification

Provide a reference list of Paper 2 sources that includes at least 2 additional source beyond target and commentary article (you can use the author's response if you plan to cite it). Below the reference list, write 1-2 sentences explaining how each additional source is relevant to Paper 2. [:What sources to identify](#x-what-sources-to-identify)

## Guidelines

### Don't include an introduction

You're still figuring out your take on this disagreement through the verification and analysis process. An introduction requires framing a question you're answering, but that framing should emerge from your analysis, not precede it. You'll write an introduction in P08 once your thesis has stabilized through peer review.

### Don't Take and Defend a Position About Which Side Is Right

It's natural to form judgments about which position seems stronger. Hold that thought for P08. For P07, focus first on why they reach different conclusions—what assumptions, definitions, or evidence interpretations drive their disagreement. If showing consequences of those differences leads you to reveal limitations of arguments, that can emerge in P08-09, but frame it as explanation of consequences rather than advocacy.

### Optional Development

If you have adequately covered the required elements, you may continue developing elements for peer review that you want feedback on, such as:

- Deeper analysis using the diagnostic questions
- More thorough engagement with additional sources you've identified
- Initial thinking about why understanding this disagreement matters for the academic conversation (you'll develop this fully in P08)

Peer review will help you determine whether the required elements need more development or whether you're ready to expand into these optional areas.

### Beginning to Think About Significance

As you develop your working thesis, start considering: Why does understanding this disagreement matter? What does it reveal about this criticism or this research area? You won't write a full significance discussion in P07, but beginning to think about these questions will help you in P08:

- What becomes difficult or unresolvable because of this disagreement?
- What does the disagreement reveal about different approaches to studying this phenomenon?
- If this disagreement were resolved, what would that require or enable?

### Remember the Process

Your working thesis should be the result of your verification of what you've learned about both positions. Expect it to evolve as you do more analysis. In P08, you'll develop your significance discussion and may deepen your thesis, but P07 focuses on establishing your baseline understanding of what drives the disagreement.

### About Depth

The analytical work described in the requirements is what all papers need—it's not optional or advanced. What distinguishes stronger papers is the depth and sophistication of your analysis past verification.

For theoretical disagreements, depth often means:

- Identifying implicit assumptions or commitments that drive the conflict
- Recognizing structural features of frameworks that produce incompatibility
- Revealing what's theoretically at stake that neither author names

For empirical disagreements, depth often means:

- Examining details in cited research to understand different data interpretations
- Identifying what each treats as sufficient evidence and why standards differ
- Revealing patterns in evidence evaluation (burden of proof, handling ambiguity, default assumptions)
- Understanding what methodological commitments drive different conclusions from the same data

Your analysis determines which aspects apply to your case.

This kind of depth emerges from thorough analytical work, not from trying to sound sophisticated.

## Peer Review Focus

During peer review, you'll:

- Explain to peers what the commentary's criticism is about
- Get feedback on what's still unclear in your explanation
- Discuss how you understand why they reach different conclusions
- Explore possible ways to evaluate the arguments (for P08)

Your peers will help you think through:

- What's still unclear about either position?
- What do they think prevents these positions from both being right?
- What would someone need to know to evaluate these positions?
- What assumptions might be driving the disagreement?

## Feedback

You will not receive instructor feedback on P07. Instead, you'll get peer review to help you clarify your thinking before developing your draft into P08. Use the peer review session to test whether your explanation is clear and to explore options with your peers.

##### :x how to explain positions

Focus on their explicit claims—what they actually say, including qualifiers that limit the strength and scope of their claims. Depending on your specific articles, this explanation might emphasize overall arguments, specific claims, or stated assumptions—whatever your analysis requires. The key is providing enough context that your reader can follow your verification and understand your thesis.

Use your P06 explanation as a starting point, but verification may reveal you need to adjust what you emphasize. Your reader needs to understand both positions well enough to follow your verification and thesis.

##### :x how to verify disagreement

After explaining both positions, verify whether they genuinely disagree at the explicit claim level. Use the room scenario test:

**Imagine the authors in a room together with a whiteboard.** The commentary says "You claim X." Does the target respond "Yes, we do claim X", "No, we actually claim Y", or "Well, sort of--we don't say 'always X', we say 'X tends to be true, but in certain contexts'".

Check the commentary's characterization against the target's actual claims:

- Does the commentary accurately represent what the target says?
- Does it preserve the target's qualifiers (must/should/can/usually/always)?
- Does it strengthen claims beyond what the target stated?
- Does it attribute claims the target doesn't make?

Document your verification in this section. Use quotations (from both articles) and explanation to show why you think the commentary's description of the target claim is accurate or inaccurate.

Your verification might reveal:

- Clean match (commentary's characterization of target's position matches target's actual position)
- Strengthened claims (commentary makes target's position more absolute than target's actual position; e.g. "X causes Y" becomes "only X causes Y")
- Target ambiguity (target's statements are vague or could mean multiple things; commentary picks one interpretation)
- Terminological confusion (same words, different definitions)

If you're using the author's response, also check whether the target accurately represents the commentary's claims. You might find:

- Mutual misreading (articles mischaracterize each other)
- Selective engagement (commentary descibes target as claiming X and Y; target replies to commentary about X but ignores Y)

Or something else entirely. Don't force your case into these patterns—they're examples,
not requirements.

Remember that verification of the commentary claims is just one step in your paper analysis. Even if your verification reveals that an apparent disagreement doesn't reflect an actual logical conflict, that's a legitimate analytical discovery, not a dead end or a problem with your choice of articles. You'll develop your thesis as you do more analysis.

##### :x how to formulate your thesis

State what your verification revealed. Your working thesis should be a claim about what prevents these positions from being compatible, based on what you discovered in your verification.

Your working thesis will take one of these forms, depending on your verification outcome:

- "They genuinely disagree because [identify the definitional, methodological, or evidentiary difference]"
- "The apparent disagreement stems from [type of mischaracterization], but the underlying issue is [what the exchange reveals]"
- "They agree on [explicit claims] but differ on [implicit assumption or framework commitment]"

These examples show different types of disagreements. The first two identify different theoretical focuses or definitional issues. The third specifically identifies different evidentiary standards—this is an empirical disagreement about what evidence is sufficient or what methods are valid for testing claims.

Don't argue that one scholar is right and the other is wrong. Instead, explain what drives the criticism, such as the assumption, definition, or methodological commitment that produces the conflict.

If in your P06 conference I suggested that you already understood the disagreement well and we discussed ways to deepen your analysis, write the thesis described here as your woring thesis, but feel free to add another "deeper working thesis" that you might discuss in peer review.

[:How theses develop through P07-P08](#x-how-theses-develop-through-p07-p08)

##### :x How theses develop through P07-P08

For students interested in understanding the developmental process: Your thesis will likely evolve through stages. This is expected, not a sign of problems.

**Starting point** (what P06 gave you):

- Understanding what each position argues
- Identifying the commentary's main criticism

**P07 working thesis** (what verification reveals):

- "They disagree because the target focuses on X while the commentary focuses on Y"
- "The apparent conflict stems from commentary's mischaracterization of Z"
- "They agree on explicit claims but differ on implicit assumption A"

**Deeper thesis** (develops in P08):

For theoretical/definitional disagreements, deeper theses often:

- Identify implicit assumptions or commitments neither author states
- Reveal structural constraints in theoretical frameworks
- Show why theoretical positions logically exclude each other

For empirical disagreements, deeper theses often:

- Reveal evidentiary standards and what each treats as sufficient proof
- Explain patterns in how data or predictions get evaluated differently
- Identify who bears burden of proof and why that matters
- Show what methodological commitments drive different interpretations

Your analysis determines which aspects matter for your case. You might address one of these or several, depending on what you discover.

Peer review will help you identify whether your verification is accurate and whether your working thesis explains what you discovered. Expect your thesis to change. What you develop in P07 is a working thesis that will likely be refined, deepened, or even reconceived as you work through P08. Verification may reveal surface-level differences that you'll later discover reflect deeper theoretical conflicts.

##### :x how to develop your analysis

Develop your thesis with specific evidence and reasoning. Answer whichever diagnostic questions fit your case—most commentaries will match one or two patterns. Your analysis should explain how these issues produce the incompatibility you identified in your thesis. Use specific evidence from both articles to develop your claims.

To identify why the positions reach different conclusions, answer whichever questions apply to your case. You don't need to answer questions that don't fit your disagreement:

- [:Pattern 1: Claims don't match evidence](#x-pattern-1)
- [:Pattern 2: Missing important factors](#x-pattern-2)
- [:Pattern 3: Definitions don't match](#x-pattern-3)
- [:Pattern 4: Wrong question or framework](#x-pattern-4)
- [:Pattern 5: Logical problems or scientific standards](#x-pattern-5)

##### :x pattern-1

**Pattern 1: Claims don't match evidence**

- Does the commentary show the target's prediction failed?
- Are there counterexamples to the target's universal claim?
- Does the target cherry-pick supporting cases while ignoring contradictory evidence?
- *Example: Verpooten & Eens argue that singing doesn't correlate with social complexity as predicted*

##### :x pattern-2

**Pattern 2: Missing important factors**

- What does the commentary say the target overlooked?
- Why does that missing factor matter for understanding the phenomenon?
- *Example: Goldstein argues that theatre lacks representational distance that target's theory requires*

##### :x pattern-3

**Pattern 3: Definitions don't match**

- Do target and commentary define key terms differently?
- If they used the commentary's definition, would the disagreement dissolve or remain?
- *Example: Norman defines "exploration" to include all non-real worlds, not just fantastical ones*

##### :x pattern-4

**Pattern 4: Wrong question or framework**

- Does the commentary say the target asked the wrong question?
- Does the commentary claim the target's approach can't work for this type of phenomenon?
- *Example: Killin argues adaptation/byproduct framework can't handle complex coevolved traits like music*

##### :x pattern-5

**Pattern 5: Logical problems or scientific standards**

- Does the commentary say the target's argument is circular or logically invalid?
- Does the commentary say the theory is too vague to test or makes no testable predictions?
- Does the commentary challenge what evidence threshold is needed (burden of proof, parsimony, defaults)?
- *Example: Stewart-Williams argues evidence is ambiguous between adaptation and byproduct; when evidence doesn't discriminate, the default should be simpler explanation*

##### :x what sources to identify

During P07, identify the additional sources you'll need for P08:

- If the commentary cites research as evidence for its claims, find and begin reading that research to evaluate whether it supports what the commentary says
- If the commentary or author's response references other work by either author, locate those sources to see whether they clarify or complicate the criticism
- If you need to understand theoretical frameworks or technical concepts mentioned in either article, find sources that explain them

List these sources in your P07 submission with brief explanation of how each will support your analysis. Remember: Additional sources should help you evaluate THIS specific criticism. They should not introduce entirely new arguments or shift focus away from the disagreement between your target and commentary.
