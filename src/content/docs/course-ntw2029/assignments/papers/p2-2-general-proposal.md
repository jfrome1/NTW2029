title: Paper 2 general topic proposal
date: 2025-02-25

---

## Assignment purpose

Paper 2 asks you to explain, analyze, and (optionally) correct or improve a published source.

The goal of the general topic proposal assignment is to identify a general topic area for Paper 2. I can use your answers to help you find a  source that will be more likely to interest you.

## Logistics

Copy and paste the following questions into the assignment text box on Canvas. Don't delete the questions--keep them and type answers below each question.

Write your answers in full sentences (where appropriate) rather than bullet points. There is no word count requirement.

1. What types of art/media are you most interested in? You can name art forms (theater, film, sculpture) or genres (romantic comedies, choral music, portrait photography).
2. Do your best to discuss the appeal of one or two of the types you mentioned above. Some things you might focus on:
	- your reactions (I like pretending to be the character, it helps me forget about my problems)
	- what makes a particular work appealing or meaningful to you (I like the color contrast; it reminds me of my brother)
	- your experience creating this type of art
3. Most EP research aims to explain things in one of two broad categories. Does one of the following broad topics appeal to you more strongly than the other?
	- why (types of) art evolved and still exist
	- why (types of) art have certain effects on audiences
4. Are you more inclined to pick a topic based on it being about a particular art form/genre (e.g. you really want to write about abstract paintings) or based on it being about a certain type of question (e.g. why are there gender differences in audience responses to X?) (it's ok if you don't know)
5. Do you currently have any questions about EP and art that you have been thinking about outside of class? (it's fine if you haven't)
6. (optional) List any questions or ideas about EP and art that you have been thinking about as possible Paper 2 topics.

Please include a GenAI link or non-use statement.

You are not committing to anything with your answers. I just want to get an idea of your thinking so I can help you find a source that will interest you.

## Guidelines

Although you aren't picking a source or a specific topic, I want to let you know about topics that won't work well for Paper 2:

- the more modern or specific an art form/genre is, the less likely its existence or features can be explained with EP (although some common responses to it might be explainable with EP)
- EP sources focus on more general and universal phenomena that are true of most people rather than more unusual or limited phenomena that may not lead to any published sources (e.g. the question "why do some people like headbanging death metal?" is an interesting question, but is unlikely to have an EP explanation)
- although there is legitimate EP research on pornography, since this course relies heavily on peer review activities, I'll ask you not to choose this topic out of respect for classmates who might be uncomfortable with the topic
- paper 2 excludes using sources that focus on debating philosophical issues such as "does X count as art?" or analyzing individual works
