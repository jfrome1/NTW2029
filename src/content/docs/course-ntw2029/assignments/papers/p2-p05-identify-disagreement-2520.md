## Purpose

This assignment helps you select a commentary and develop a clear understanding of its criticism before detailed analysis begins. By identifying relevant target passages now, you'll have the raw material needed for verification work in P06.

## Overview

Select a commentary article that criticizes your target, then answer questions about the criticism and locate the relevant passages in the target article. This is comprehension work, not analysis—your goal is to understand what each article says.

Note: Since you'll discuss each other's topics in detail during peer review, I'd like all students in each section to write about different article pairs. I don't think this will be an issue, and I'm fine if a few students choose the same pair but write about different criticisms.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the questions below into a document and type your answer below each question. Keep the questions numbered.

### Part 1: Select Your Commentary

Choose one commentary from the recommended list below (or propose an alternative). Read the full commentary, not just the abstract.

### Part 2: Answer These Questions

For each question, first explain in your own words, then provide the quotation that supports your explanation. <span class="smaller-text"> [:Why gather so many quotations?](#x-why-gather-so-many-quotations) </span>

---

**Question 1: What criticism does the commentary make?**

In 2-3 sentences, describe the main criticism the commentary makes of the target article. Focus on one specific criticism if the commentary makes several.

---

**Question 2: How does the commentary describe the target's position?**

First, paraphrase in one sentence how the commentary describes what the target claims.

Then, quote a passage (2-4 sentences with page number) where the commentary describes the target's position.

---

**Question 3: What does the commentary claim is problematic?**

First, paraphrase in one sentence what the commentary says is wrong with the target's position.

Then, quote a passage (2-4 sentences with page number) where the commentary states what's problematic.

---

**Question 4: Which target passages are relevant to this criticism?**

Quote 2-3 passages from the target article that discuss the topic the commentary criticizes. Include page numbers.

---

**Question 5: What does the target actually say in these passages?**

For each passage you quoted in Question 4, explain in your own words what the target is claiming. Don't evaluate whether the commentary is right—just explain what the target says.

---

**Question 6: What reasoning supports the commentary's criticism?**

First, explain in your own words the commentary's argument—what evidence or logic does the commentary use to support its criticism?

Then, quote 1-2 key passages (with page numbers) that show the commentary's reasoning.

---

**Question 7: Does the author respond to this criticism?**

The target article's authors respond to the commentaries as a group. Does their response address this specific criticism? [:How do I find the author's response?](#x-how-do-i-find-the-authors-response)

First, state whether the authors address your criticism or not.

If they do, quote the relevant passage (with page number) and briefly paraphrase what they say.

## Recommended Commentaries

### Target Article 1: Dubourg & Baumard (2022) - Why Imaginary Worlds?

*Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e276: 1-72

- Main article: pp. 1-18
- Author's response: p. 63

**Recommended commentaries:**

Dunk, R., & Mar, R. A. (2022). Cognitive exploration drives engagement and re-engagement with imaginary worlds, but not spatial exploration as predicted by evolutionary theory. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *45*, e281. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X21002168

> *Abstract:* The empirical evidence for exploration underlying the appeal of imaginary worlds is mostly absent or contradictory. Openness, and the cognitive exploration it represents, provides a better account than the overall drive to explore predicted by evolutionary theory. Furthermore, exploration cannot explain why imaginary worlds foster frequent re-engagement.

---

Moore, R., & Hills, T. (2022). The evolution of imagination and the adaptive value of imaginary worlds. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *45*, e288. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X2100217X

> *Abstract:* Characterizing the cultural evolution of imaginary worlds as a hedonic but non-adaptive exaptation from evolved exploratory tendencies, Dubourg and Baumard defend too narrow a conception of the adaptive evolution of imaginary worlds. Imagination and its imaginary worlds are ancient and adaptive, allowing deliberation over actions, consequences, and futures worth aspiring to, often engendering the world we see around us.

---

Norman, K. E., & Goldstein, T. R. (2022). All non-real worlds provide exploration: Evidence from developmental psychology. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *45*, e290. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X21002314

> *Abstract:* While Dubourg and Baumard argue that predisposition toward exploration draws us to fictional environments, they fail to answer their titular question: "Why Imaginary Worlds?" Research in pretend play, psychological distancing, and theatre shows that being "imaginary" (i.e., any type of unreal, rather than only fantastically unreal) makes exploration of any fictional world profoundly different than that of real-life unfamiliar environments.

---

Nyhout, A., & Lee, R. (2022). Young children are not driven to explore imaginary worlds. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *45*, e291. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X2100234X

> *Abstract:* We address Dubourg and Baumard's claim that imaginary worlds are most appealing early in the lifespan when the exploratory drive is highest. Preschool-age children prefer fictions set in the real world, and fantastical information can be difficult for children to represent in real time. We speculate that a drive to explore imaginary worlds may emerge after children acquire substantial real-world skills and knowledge. An account of age effects on fictional preferences should encompass developmental change.

---

Shtulman, A. (2022). The familiar appeal of imaginary worlds. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *45*, e298. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X21002338

> *Abstract:* Imaginary worlds may satisfy our need to explore, but it's an open question what we are searching for. Research on imagination suggests that if we are searching for something extraordinary - something that violates our intuitions about real-world causality - then we seek it in small doses and in contexts that ultimately confirm our intuitions. Imaginary worlds allow for true novelty, but we may actually prefer ideas that are novel on their surface but familiar at their core.

### Target Article 2: Menninghaus et al. (2017) - Negative Emotions in Art

*Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40, e347: 1-63

- Main article: pp. 1-15
- Author's response: p. 58

**Recommended commentaries:**

Bullot, N. J., & Reber, R. (2017). Artistic misunderstandings: The emotional significance of historical learning in the arts. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *40*, e354. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17001625

> *Abstract:* The Distancing-Embracing model does not have the conceptual resources to explain artistic misunderstandings and the emotional consequences of historical learning in the arts. Specifically, it suggests implausible predictions about emotional distancing caused by art schemata (e.g., misunderstandings of artistic intentions and contexts). These problems show the need for further inquiries into how historical contextualization modulates negative emotions in the arts.

---

Davies, S. (2017). Distancing, not embracing, the Distancing-Embracing model of art reception. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *40*, e357. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17001650

> *Abstract:* Despite denials in the target article, the Distancing-Embracing model appeals to compensatory ideas in explaining the appeal of artworks that elicit negative affect. The model also appeals to the deflationary effects of psychological distancing. Having pointed to the famous rejection in the 1960s of the view that aesthetic experience involves psychological distancing, I suggest that "distance" functions here as a weak metaphor that cannot sustain the explanatory burden the theory demands of it.

---

Goldstein, T. R. (2017). Live theatre as exception and test case for experiencing negative emotions in art. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *40*, e362. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17001704

> *Abstract:* Distancing and then embracing constitutes a useful way of thinking about the paradox of aesthetic pleasure. However, the model does not account for live theatre. When live actors perform behaviors perceptually close to real life and possibly really experienced by the actors, audiences may experience autonomic reactions, with less distance, or may have to distance post-experiencing/embracing their emotions.

---

Konečni, V. J. (2017). "Negative emotions" live in stories, not in the hearts of readers who enjoy them. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *40*, e367. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17001753

> *Abstract:* The commendably ambitious project by Menninghaus et al. fails because its main connective tissue - "negative emotions" - is beyond the grasp of the authors' largely literary approach. The critique focuses on their treatment of the Paradox of Fiction, the neglect of the biological, adaptive nature of emotions, and the absence of convincing empirical support for key aspects of the proposed model.

---

Nadal, M., Vartanian, O., & Skov, M. (2017). Psychological models of art reception must be empirically grounded. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *40*, e371. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17001790

> *Abstract:* We commend Menninghaus et al. for tackling the role of negative emotions in art reception. However, their model suffers from shortcomings that reduce its applicability to empirical studies of the arts: poor use of evidence, lack of integration with other models, and limited derivation of testable hypotheses. We argue that theories about art experiences should be based on empirical evidence.

---

Schubert, T. W., Seibt, B., Zickfeld, J. H., Blomster, J. K., & Fiske, A. P. (2017). Being moved is a positive emotion, and emotions should not be equated with their vernacular labels. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *40*, e374. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17001820

> *Abstract:* As evidence for the second process of the Embracing factor, the target article characterizes being moved as a mixed emotion linked to sadness through metonymy. We question these characterizations and argue that emotions should not be equated with their vernacular labels.

---

Weisberg, D. S., & Friend, S. (2017). Embracing nonfiction: How to extend the Distancing-Embracing model. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *40*, e379. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17001881

> *Abstract:* The Distancing factor of Menninghaus et al.'s model includes schemas that remind consumers that the representation is fictional. Although they claim that these schemas are crucial to the functioning of the Embracing factor of the model, we argue that consumers can have similar responses to nonfictional representations. We urge the authors to expand their model to include such cases.

### Target Article 3: Savage et al. (2021) - Music as Social Bonding

*Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e59: 1-77

- Main article: pp. 1-22
- Author's response: p. 61

**Recommended commentaries:**

Fritz, J. B. (2021). Is the MSB hypothesis (music as a coevolved system for social bonding) testable in the Popperian sense? *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *44*, e70. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20001739

> *Abstract:* "Music As a Coevolved System for Social Bonding" (MSB) is a brilliant synthesis and appealing hypothesis offering insights into the evolution and social bonding of musicality, but is so broad and sweeping it will be challenging to test, prove or falsify in the Popperian sense (Popper, 1959). After general comments, I focus my critique on underlying neurobiological mechanisms, and offer some suggestions for experimental tests of MSB.

---

Harrison, P. M. C., & Seale, M. (2021). Against unitary theories of music evolution. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *44*, e76. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20001314

> *Abstract:* Savage et al. and Mehr et al. provide well-substantiated arguments that the evolution of musicality was shaped by adaptive functions of social bonding and credible signalling. However, they are too quick to dismiss byproduct explanations of music evolution, and to present their theories as complete unitary accounts of the phenomenon.

**Note:** This commentary addresses both Savage and Mehr target articles and can be used for either.

---

Merker, B. (2021). Music, bonding, and human evolution: A critique. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *44*, e83. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20001429

> *Abstract:* Savage et al. propose that music filled a hypothetical "bonding gap" in human sociality by Baldwinian gene-culture coevolution (or protracted cognitive niche construction). Both these stepping stones to an evolutionary account of the function and origin of music are problematic. They are scrutinized in this commentary, and an alternative is proposed.

---

Verpooten, J., & Eens, M. (2021). Singing is not associated with social complexity across species. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *44*, e92. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20001120

> *Abstract:* Based on their social bonding hypothesis, Savage et al. predict a relation between "musical" behaviors and social complexity across species. However, our qualitative comparative review suggests that, although learned contact calls are positively associated with complex social dynamics across species, songs are not. Yet, in contrast to songs, and arguably consistent with their functions, contact calls are not particularly music-like.

### Target Article 4: Mehr et al. (2021) - Music as Credible Signaling

*Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e60: 1-87

- Main article: pp. 1-23
- Author's response: p. 69

**Recommended commentaries:**

Harrison, P. M. C., & Seale, M. (2021). Against unitary theories of music evolution. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *44*, e76. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20001314

> *Abstract:* Savage et al. and Mehr et al. provide well-substantiated arguments that the evolution of musicality was shaped by adaptive functions of social bonding and credible signalling. However, they are too quick to dismiss byproduct explanations of music evolution, and to present their theories as complete unitary accounts of the phenomenon.

**Note:** This commentary addresses both Savage and Mehr target articles and can be used for either.

---

Killin, A., Brusse, C., Currie, A., & Planer, R. J. (2021). Not by signalling alone: Music's mosaicism undermines the search for a proper function. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *44*, e103. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20001107

> *Abstract:* Mehr et al. seek to explain music's evolution in terms of a unitary proper function - signalling cooperative intent - which they cash out in two guises, coalition signalling and (allo)parental attention signalling. Although we recognize the role signalling almost certainly played in the evolution of music, we reject "ultimate" causal explanations which focus on a unidirectional, narrow range of causal factors.

---

Lieberman, D., & Billingsley, J. (2021). If it quacks like a duck: The by-product account of music still stands. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *44*, e106. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20000990

> *Abstract:* Discerning adaptations from by-products is a defining feature of evolutionary science. Mehr, Krasnow, Bryant, and Hagen posit that music is an adaptation that evolved to function as a credible signal. We counter this claim, as we are not convinced they have dispelled the possibility that music is an elaboration of extant features of language.

---

Pinker, S. (2021). Sex and drugs and rock and roll. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *44*, e109. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20001375

> *Abstract:* This article is extraordinarily rigorous and rich, although there are reasons to be skeptical of its theory that music originated to signal group quality and infant solicitude. These include the lack of any signature of the centrality of these functions in the distribution or experience of music; of a role for the pleasure taken in music; and of its connections with language.

---

Stewart-Williams, S. (2021). Making music: Let's not be too quick to abandon the byproduct hypothesis. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, *44*, e113. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20001119

> *Abstract:* It is premature to conclude that music is an adaptation. Given the danger of overextending the adaptationist mode of explanation, the default position should be the byproduct hypothesis, and it should take very strong evidence to drag us into the adaptationist camp. As yet, the evidence isn't strong enough - and the proposed adaptationist explanations have a number of unresolved difficulties.

## Guidelines

### Choosing Your Commentary

Look for commentaries that identify a specific problem with the target's argument, not just different views. Strong criticisms typically claim the target:

- Overlooks contradicting evidence
- Makes predictions that don't hold
- Defines key concepts too narrowly or broadly
- Can't explain important cases within its proposed scope
- Relies on flawed premises or reasoning

Avoid commentaries that merely offer alternative theories without showing problems in the target article.

### Reading the Full Commentary

Abstracts can be misleading. Once you identify candidates, read the full articles before choosing. A commentary that seems promising from its abstract may turn out to be less substantive than expected.

### Focusing on One Criticism

Commentary articles typically make several different arguments. For P2, focus on ONE specific criticism. You can mention related points, but maintain focus on one central issue.

For example, the Konečni (2017) commentary on Menninghaus et al. addresses multiple topics: (1) treatment of the Paradox of Fiction, (2) neglect of the biological nature of emotions, (3) lack of empirical support, (4) the concept of distancing, and (5) music and emotions. If you chose this commentary, you would need to choose ONE of these to analyze for P2 (but don't choose this one since we discussed it in class).

### What This Assignment Doesn't Ask

Don't try to determine whether the commentary's criticism is right or wrong. You need to reserve judgment until after you actually analyze the articles and gain a deep understanding of them. Your job here is to take the first step in getting a general understanding what each article says and to gather the relevant passages.

## Feedback

I'll provide brief written feedback identifying any clear misunderstandings, plus peer review discussion about whether your chosen criticism is workable.

##### :x how do i find the authors response

To find passages relevant to your specific commentary: (1) Open the file with the target and commentary articles, (2) Search (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) for your commentary author's last name, (3) Read any passages in the author's response where they cite or discuss your commentary.

##### :x Why gather so many quotations?

These passages become the raw material for P06, where you'll verify whether the commentary accurately represents what the target says. Gathering them now means you won't have to hunt for them later.
