fixes for next time:

- note in advance that feedback will ask questions that are not criticisms, but are intended to help students think through the issues

## Purpose

This exercise develops your ability to identify criticisms suitable for analysis, locate relevant evidence in source texts, and assess significance. You'll practice reading scholarly commentaries critically and verifying your comprehension before investing time in longer assignments.

## Overview

Answer seven questions about one specific criticism from your chosen commentary.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the questions below into a document and type your answer below each question. Keep the question numbered. No word count limit, but some questions have sentence limits.

### Questions to Answer

For each question, check the guidelines below before answering. Use in-text citations (page numbers are fine) for both paraphrasing and direct quotations.

---

1. What is the target article's main argument?
2. Pick just one criticism from the commentary article. For this criticism, how does the commentary describe the target article's position?
3. What does the commentary article claim is problematic about the target article's position?
4. Locate the section(s) of the target article that the commentary discusses. Quote or describe what the target says about this topic. If you notice discrepancies between the commentary's characterization and the target's actual content, note them for peer review discussion.
5. Explain the significance of this criticism in 1-3 sentences. What would be the consequences for the target's argument if the commentary is correct?
6. The target article's authors respond to the commentaries as a group. Does their response address this specific criticism? If the authors address this point, what do they say?
7. Briefly explain the commentary's argument supporting their criticism of the target article.

## Guidelines

### Choosing One Criticism

Commentary articles typically make several different arguments about the target article. For P2, you should focus on ONE specific criticism. (You can always expand to other aspects later if needed.)

For example, the Konečni (2017) commentary on Menninghaus et al. addresses multiple topics: (1) treatment of the Paradox of Fiction, (2) neglect of the biological nature of emotions, (3) lack of empirical support, (4) the concept of distancing, and (5) music and emotions. If you chose this commentary, you would need to choose ONE of these to analyze for P2 (but don't choose this one since we discussed it in class).

### Answering the Questions

- For Question 1: Provide a brief overview (3-4 sentences) of the target article's argument. Don't try to capture the details; instead try to give a sense of the general "shape" of the argument, especially as it relates to the existing academic conversation.
- For Question 2: Quote a specific passage where the commentary article describes the target article's position and briefly paraphrase it in your own words (paraphrase in 1 sentence max). [Why do I need to both quote and paraphrase?](#why-do-i-need-to-both-quote-and-paraphrase)
- For Question 3: Quote a specific passage where the commentary article describes what's problematic about the target article and briefly paraphrase the claim in your own words (paraphrase in 1 sentence max). Just identify what the commentary claims is problematic, don't explain the reasoning (e.g., your paraphrase might say, "Smith says that the target article misunderstands the concept of 'adaptation'").
- For Question 4:  Quote specific passages if the commentary discusses explicit claims or quote the relevant section even if the criticism is about what's missing, unclear, or unspecified in that section. [:Why check for accuracy?](#x-why-check-for-accuracy)
- For Question 5: In other words, if the commentary is correct, what would that mean for the target article's argument? Would it mean that we should reject its conclusions, or that the theory would need to be clarified, or something else? Explain this significance in 1-3 sentences, giving reasons for your position. If the disagreement wouldn't matter very much, choose a different disagreement. [:Why check significance?](#x-why-check-significance)
- For Question 6: The author's response to all commentaries appears in the same BBS issue, typically after all the individual commentaries. Quote any passages where the authors respond to your criticism and briefly paraphrase any response in your own words. Note: Authors may not address every point a commentary makes—if they don't address your point, just state that. [How do I find whether the authors respond to my commentary?](#how-do-i-find-whether-the-authors-respond-to-my-commentary)
- For Question 7: Focus on the commentary's reasoning—what evidence or arguments do they provide to back up their claim?

## Feedback

You will receive brief written feedback identifying any clear misunderstandings, plus peer review discussion about whether your chosen criticism is workable.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need to both quote and paraphrase?

The quotation lets me see exactly what the article states without having to search it up myself for every student. The paraphrase helps me see if you are correctly interpreting what the article says.

### How do I find whether the authors respond to my commentary?

To find passages relevant to your specific commentary: (1) Open the file with the target and commentary articles, (2) Search (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) for your commentary author's last name, (3) Read any passages in the author's response where they cite or discuss your commentary.

##### :x Why quote and also paraphrase?

The quotation lets me see exactly what the article states without having to search it up myself for every student. The paraphrase helps me see if you are correctly interpreting what the article says.

##### :x Why check for accuracy?

Your goal is to make sure that the commentary isn't "strawmanning" the target article, because it's very hard to write a good P2 if there's not a genuine disagreement of positions.

##### :x Why check significance?

Your goal is to make sure that the commentary isn't focused on an insignificant part of the argument, because it means that the target and commentary articles aren't focused on the same academic conversation, which makes it very hard to write a good P2.

##### :x How do I find whether  the authors respond?

To find passages relevant to your specific commentary: (1) Open the file with the target and commentary articles, (2) Search (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) for your commentary author's last name, (3) Read any passages in the author's response where they cite or discuss your commentary.
