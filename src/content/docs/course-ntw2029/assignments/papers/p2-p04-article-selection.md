## Purpose

This exercise helps you select a suitable pair of articles for Paper 2.

## Overview

Submit a brief proposal identifying your target article, commentary article, and a possible topic for Paper 2 based on the commentary article. The commentary articles vary in how many arguments they present, so you'll identify one specific argument/topic/issue from that article.

Note: Since you will discuss each other's topics in detail during peer review, I'd like all students in each section to write about different article pairs. I don't think this will be an issue, and I'm ok if a few students choose the same pair of articles but write about different topics. However, if by some weird coincidence everyone chooses the same articles and topics within those articles, I may ask some students for a 2nd choice.

## Requirements

Your proposal must include:

1. Target article - Which of the four BBS target articles you've chosen
2. Commentary article - Which commentary you've selected from the recommended list below
3. Possible topic - Which specific topic from the commentary article you might focus on for Paper 2 (you can change this later). 1-2 sentences is fine.

That's it. This is intended to be a short assignment.

## Guidelines

### Choosing Your Commentary

For each target article, I've recommended 4-5 commentaries below, but you may choose any commentary article from the same BBS issues. I aimed to find relatively clear commentaries that seemed to include substantive disagreements, but I make no guarantees--you are responsible for all aspects of Paper 2, including your choice of articles.

### What to Avoid

Choose a disagreement that's substantial enough to analyze in depth.

Avoid commentaries that misrepresent the target article (i.e. criticize a strawman). Different interpretations are fine, but if the commentary attributes a claim to the target that the target doesn't make, you'll have difficulty writing a meaningful analysis.

Avoid obviously weak arguments. It might seem easier to choose a commentary that makes a bad argument (less ambiguity about who's right could seem to make the paper faster and easier to write) but weak arguments will actually make your paper harder to write. They limit the depth of analysis you can do and reduce the significance of your contribution to the academic conversation, which is part of your grade.
