## Assignment

### Purpose

This assignment has two important purposes. First, it helps you develop a clear thesis statement and analytical direction for Paper 2 by requiring you to articulate exactly what you plan to analyze about your source and why it matters. Second, it helps you understand the structure of your source's argument, not just the main claim, by requiring you to create a (new or revised) source summary outline.

### Overview

You will submit a comprehensive proposal that answers specific questions about your planned Paper 2 analysis, along with a new or revised source summary outline that accurately reflects the structure of your source's argument.

## Instructions

- write the proposal and outline according to the below instructions
- submit the proposal and outline as one document, with the proposal first and the outline starting on a new page
- use your main source citation information as your proposal title (properly formatted as if in a reference list)
- follow paper assignment and outline guidelines, including GenAI statement and word count

### Part 1: Proposal

Prepare your proposal by answering the following questions in full sentences using a clear, formal style. Copy and paste these questions into a document so I can see the questions above your answers (you can delete any example answers I give).

1. What is the academic conversation to which the source aims to contribute? Make sure to identify the phenomenon the conversation aims to explain and consider what your source says "they say". Be specific rather than general.
      - Example (too general): "The source aims to contribute to the academic discussion about how music evolved in humans."
      - Example (appropriately specific): "The source aims to contribute to the academic discussion about which of three specific theories best explains how music evolved in humans: social cohesion, parent-infant signaling, and mate attraction."
2. What are the source's main theses or conclusions that contribute to this academic conversation? (1-3 main claims only)
3. Which one of these claims (or contributing sub-claim) do you plan to analyze? Pick a claim that seems (most likely to be) incomplete, ambiguous, problematic, or limited in some way.
4. Write a 250 word (max) summary of the argument the source uses to support the claim. Make sure the summary clearly connects the claim to the academic conversation. The summary is a narrative presentation of the argument.
5. In a list or outline form, state brief summaries of the reasons and evidence (if any) supporting the claim, as well as any important assumptions the claim relies on. The list is a way to think of the claim as the logical conclusion of premises in an argument.
      - Note: 4 and 5 are intentionally redundant; I'm asking you to convey the argument in two different ways because it can be helpful to think about things from different angles.
6. If you can, suggest one or two possible ways you are thinking about evaluating, correcting, or improving the argument.
7. If you can, suggest why your challenge might be significant to the academic conversation about this topic. Even if you can't do it right now, in your final paper, you will have to explain why your discussion is significant to the academic conversation.

## Part 2: Source summary outline

- Revise your source summary outline based on peer feedback, ensuring it meets all outline requirements.
- The outline should accurately represent the logical structure of your source's argument.
- Write and format it according to outline guidelines.

## Guidelines for answering the proposal questions

### Understanding "They Say"

To effectively analyze your source, you must understand what "they say":

- The academic conversation the source aims to contribute to
- What others have contributed to this conversation
- The source thesis and supporting argument(s)
- How the source argument contributes (or tries to contribute) to the academic conversation

### Developing What "I Say"

This proposal is your first step in developing your own analytical response:

- For theoretical sources, focus on a narrow part of the overall argument
- For empirical sources, identify criticisms that contribute to a unifying, evaluative claim about the source

### Avoiding common analytical pitfalls

Be cautious about these common analytical approaches, which often lead to weak papers:

- "I argue that X is not the only factor causing Y" (do they claim it's the only factor? usually they don't)
- "They explain A, but not B, and I fill the gap by explaining B" (is B needed to support A or is it a separate topic/question? does the source intend to discuss B? if not, you're not participating in the same academic conversation)
- "The theory doesn't fully/completely explain all examples of the phenomenon" (is their goal to do this? is it possible to do this? do the exceptions undermine their argument or show that it is never true, or just that it's not perfect?)

## Checklist

- Proposal included with answers to all required questions
- Main source citation properly formatted as the proposal title
- Revised source summary outline follows outline guidelines
- GenAI link or non-use statement included
- Updated workload report submitted under Exercise 10

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist reminds you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it is not a comprehensive summary of all requirements. You must read the complete assignment description to fully understand what's expected.

## Feedback

I will review your submission and provide feedback before our conferences the following week. My feedback will focus on whether your proposed analysis is sufficiently focused and significant to the academic conversation, and whether your source summary outline clearly and accurately explains the source argument.
