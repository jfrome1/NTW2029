## Assignment purpose

- Although your paper will develop and change over time, it's best to propose a thesis early so you can figure out what will or won't work and so I can give you feedback.
- Your proposal will be your first step towards these goals. Ignore any ideas you currently have about what counts as a paper proposal. Do not send a list of general notes and ideas about the source text. Distilling your notes and ideas into a focused proposal is a skill you must develop. You need to turn those notes into clear, concise answers to the below questions before submitting them to me.
- You will also revise your source summary outline based on feedback from peer review. I'll offer feedback on the revised outline before our conference next week, so make sure it meets outline requirements.

## Logistics

- The proposal will consist of answers to the following questions, written in full sentences in a clear, formal style.
- Use your main source citation information as your proposal title (properly formatted as if in a reference list).
- Copy/paste these questions into your proposal and put your answers below each question:

1. What is the academic conversation to which the source aims to contribute? Make sure to identify the phenomenon the conversation aims to explain and consider what your source says "they say". Be specific rather than general.
	- e.g. general: "The source aims to contribute to the academic discussion about how music evolved in humans."
	- e.g. specific: "The source aims to contribute to the academic discussion about which of three specific theories best explains how music evolved in humans: social cohesion, parent-infant signaling, and mate attraction."
2. What are the sources' main theses or conclusions that contribute to this academic conversation? (1-3 main claims only)
3. Which one of these claims (or contributing sub-claim) do you plan to analyze? Pick a claim that seems (most likely to be) incomplete, ambiguous, problematic, or limited in some way.
4. Write a 250 word (max) summary of the argument the source uses to support the claim. Make sure the summary clearly connects the claim to the academic conversation. The summary is a narrative presentation of the argument.
5. In a list or outline form, state brief summaries of the reasons and evidence (if any) supporting the claim, as well as any important assumptions the claim relies on. The list is a way to think of the claim as the logical conclusion of premises in an argument.
	- note: items 4 and 5 are intentionally redundant; I'm asking you to convey the argument in 2 different ways because it can be helpful to think about things from a different angle
6. If you can, suggest one or two possible ways you are thinking about evaluating, correcting, or improving the argument.
7. If you can, suggest why your challenge might be significant to the academic conversation about this topic. Even if you can't do it right now, in your final paper, you will have to explain why your discussion is significant to the academic conversation.

- We will discuss your proposal in individual conferences next week

## Guidelines

- In order for you to "come to terms" with your source, you must understand what "they say":
	- the academic conversation the source aims to contribute to
	- what others have contributed to this conversation
	- the source thesis and supporting argument(s)
	- how the source argument contributes (or tries to contribute) to the academic conversation
- This proposal is the first step in figuring out what "I say" (or is it what "you say"? You know what I mean):
	- for theoretical sources, figure out a narrow part of the overall argument to focus on
	- for empirical sources, the research is already narrow, so you might have several different types of criticisms; if you pick several of them, they should all contribute to a unifying overall theme or point
- Red flags for the "I say" in your proposal--if you are thinking along these lines, make sure to first pause and answer the listed questions:
	- "I argue that X is not the only factor causing Y" (do they say it is the only factor? usually they don't)
	- "They explain A, but not B, and I fill the gap by explaining B" (is B needed to support A or is it a separate topic/question? does the source intend to discuss B? if not, you're not participating in the same academic conversation.)
	- "The theory doesn't fully/completely explain the all examples of the phenomenon" (is their goal to do this? is it possible to do this? do the exceptions undermine their argument or show that it is never true, or just that it's not perfect?)

## Submission

- Submit both parts of the assignment on Canvas as one document. Please follow exercise guidelines, include a GenAI link or non-use statement, and submit an updated workload report under Exercise 10.
