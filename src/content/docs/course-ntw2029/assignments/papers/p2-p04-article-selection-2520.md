<!-- TO FIX: The weak/strong explanation examples need to be rewritten. Original P04 deliberately used examples not from articles students would actually read. New examples should follow that same approach - generic enough to teach the principle without using the actual course articles. -->

## Purpose

This assignment develops your ability to understand and articulate a scholarly argument before encountering criticism of it. By explaining the target's argument in your own words, you'll identify what you understand clearly and where ambiguities remain—essential groundwork for evaluating criticisms in P05.

## Overview

Select one of the four target articles and explain its main argument (approximately 400-500 words). You'll address four elements of the argument, providing your own explanation, a supporting quotation, and notes on any ambiguities for each.

Note: For peer review to work well, I need a reasonably even distribution of target article choices across each section. After you've selected your article, post your choice on the section Telegram channel. If you see that many students have already chosen a particular article, consider selecting a different one. You don't need to change if you have a strong preference, but aim for balance where possible.

## Requirements

### 1. Select Your Target Article

Choose one of the following BBS target articles:

- Dubourg, E., & Baumard, N. (2022). Why imaginary worlds? The psychological foundations and cultural evolution of fictions with imaginary worlds. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e276: 1-72.
- Menninghaus, W., Wagner, V., Hanich, J., Wassiliwizky, E., Jacobsen, T., & Koelsch, S. (2017). The Distancing-Embracing model of the enjoyment of negative emotions in art reception. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40, e347: 1-63.
- Savage, P. E., Loui, P., Tarr, B., Schachner, A., Glowacki, L., Mithen, S., & Fitch, W. T. (2021). Music as a coevolved system for social bonding. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e59: 1-77.
- Mehr, S. A., Krasnow, M. M., Bryant, G. A., & Hagen, E. H. (2021). Origins of music in credible signaling. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e60: 1-87.

### 2. Explain the Target's Argument

For each of the four elements below, do three things:

- **(a)** Explain it in your own words
- **(b)** Provide a supporting quotation with page number (more than one sentence is OK)
- **(c)** State whether the article's meaning is clear or unclear on this element. If unclear, note the ambiguity (places where the article could mean multiple things).

**Element 1: Phenomenon**

What phenomenon does the target article claim to explain? Be specific about what the authors are trying to account for.

**Element 2: Mechanism**

What explanation or mechanism does the target propose? How does the target say the phenomenon works or why it exists?

**Element 3: Evidence**

What main evidence or reasoning supports the target's explanation? What do the authors point to as support for their claims?

**Element 4: Contribution**

What do the target authors claim is new or different about their approach compared to existing theories?

Detailed guidance below.

## Guidelines

### Writing Your Explanations

Your own-words explanations should demonstrate understanding, not just reword the source. I'm looking for explanations that could help someone unfamiliar with the article understand the concept.

**[TO FIX: Replace with better examples]**

**Example of weak explanation (rewording):**
> "The model proposes that the phenomenon occurs because of an evolved mechanism that was adaptive in ancestral environments."

**Example of strong explanation (demonstrating understanding):**
> "The model proposes that this behavior exists because ancestors who engaged in it were more likely to survive and reproduce. Specifically, the behavior helped them form stronger social bonds with group members, which provided protection and resource-sharing advantages. Over many generations, individuals with a psychological tendency toward this behavior outcompeted those without it, so the tendency became widespread in the population."

The strong example explains *why* the mechanism would have been adaptive and *how* the evolutionary process works, not just that it was adaptive. It shows you understand the logic connecting the behavior to the proposed evolutionary outcome.

If you find yourself unable to explain something in your own words, that's useful information—note it as an ambiguity rather than guessing. It's better to acknowledge confusion now than to build later work on a shaky foundation.

### Selecting Quotations

Choose quotations that directly support your explanation. Brief quotations (1-2 sentences) are usually more useful than long passages. Include page numbers so I can locate the passage if needed.

### Noting Clarity or Ambiguity

For each element, state whether the article's meaning seems clear or unclear to you. It's fine if most elements are clear—that's useful information too.

If something is unclear, ambiguities might include:

- Terms the article uses without defining
- Claims that could mean different things
- Scope that isn't clearly specified (e.g., does the article claim this is always true, usually true, or sometimes true?)

Identifying ambiguities isn't a sign of failure—it's valuable preparation for later assignments where you'll need to pin down exactly what the target claims.

### Building Toward P05

Your understanding of the target article will inform your commentary selection in P05. A solid grasp of what the target claims makes it easier to identify which commentaries raise substantive criticisms versus tangential objections.

## Feedback

I'll provide group feedback organized by target article, with brief individual comments where needed.
