## Purpose

This assignment develops your ability to understand and articulate a scholarly argument before encountering criticism of it. By explaining the target's argument in your own words, you'll identify what you understand clearly and where ambiguities remain—essential groundwork for evaluating criticisms in P05.

## Overview

Select one of the four target articles and explain its main argument. You'll address four elements of the argument, providing your own explanation, a supporting quotation, and notes on any ambiguities for each.

Note: For peer review to work well, I need a reasonably even distribution of target article choices across each section. After you've selected your article, post your choice on the section Telegram channel. If you see that many students have already chosen a particular article, consider selecting a different one. You don't need to change if you have a strong preference, but aim for balance where possible.

## Requirements

### 1. Select Your Target Article

Choose one of the following BBS target articles:

- Dubourg & Baumard (2022) - "Why Imaginary Worlds?"
- Menninghaus et al. (2017) - "Negative Emotions in Art"
- Savage et al. (2021) - "Music as Social Bonding"
- Mehr et al. (2021) - "Music as Credible Signaling"

### 2. Explain the Target's Argument

For each of the four elements below, do three things:

- **(a)** Explain in your own words
- **(b)** Provide one supporting quotation with page number
- **(c)** Note any ambiguities (places where the article is unclear or could mean multiple things)

**Element 1: Phenomenon**

What phenomenon does the target article claim to explain? Be specific about what the authors are trying to account for.

**Element 2: Mechanism**

What explanation or mechanism does the target propose? How does the target say the phenomenon works or why it exists?

**Element 3: Evidence**

What main evidence or reasoning supports the target's explanation? What do the authors point to as support for their claims?

**Element 4: Contribution**

What do the target authors claim is new or different about their approach compared to existing theories?

## Guidelines

### Writing Your Explanations

Your own-words explanations should demonstrate understanding, not just reword the source. I'm looking for explanations that could help someone unfamiliar with the article understand the concept.

If you find yourself unable to explain something in your own words, that's useful information—note it as an ambiguity rather than guessing. It's better to acknowledge confusion now than to build later work on a shaky foundation.

### Selecting Quotations

Choose quotations that directly support your explanation. Brief quotations (1-2 sentences) are usually more useful than long passages. Include page numbers so I can locate the passage if needed.

### Noting Ambiguities

Ambiguities might include:

- Terms the article uses without defining
- Claims that could mean different things
- Scope that isn't clearly specified (e.g., does the article claim this is always true, usually true, or sometimes true?)

Note that identifying ambiguities isn't a sign of failure—it's valuable preparation for later assignments where you'll need to pin down exactly what the target claims.

### Building Toward P05

Your understanding of the target article will inform your commentary selection in P05. A solid grasp of what the target claims makes it easier to identify which commentaries raise substantive criticisms versus tangential objections.

## Feedback

You'll receive group feedback organized by target article, with brief individual comments where needed.
