## Purpose

This assignment develops your ability to understand and articulate a scholarly argument before encountering criticism of it. By explaining the target's argument in your own words, you'll identify what you understand clearly and where ambiguities remain—essential groundwork for evaluating criticisms in P05.

## Overview

Select one of the four target articles and explain its main argument. You'll address four elements of the argument, providing your own explanation, a supporting quotation, and notes on any ambiguities for each. No word count requirement.

Note: For peer review to work well, I need a reasonably even distribution of target article choices across each section. After you've selected your article, post your choice on the section Telegram channel. If you see that many students have already chosen a particular article, consider selecting a different one. You don't need to change if you have a strong preference, but aim for balance where possible.

## Requirements

### 1. Select Your Target Article

Choose one of the following BBS target articles:

- Dubourg, E., & Baumard, N. (2022). Why imaginary worlds? The psychological foundations and cultural evolution of fictions with imaginary worlds. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e276: 1-72.
- Menninghaus, W., Wagner, V., Hanich, J., Wassiliwizky, E., Jacobsen, T., & Koelsch, S. (2017). The Distancing-Embracing model of the enjoyment of negative emotions in art reception. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40, e347: 1-63.
- Savage, P. E., Loui, P., Tarr, B., Schachner, A., Glowacki, L., Mithen, S., & Fitch, W. T. (2021). Music as a coevolved system for social bonding. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e59: 1-77.
- Mehr, S. A., Krasnow, M. M., Bryant, G. A., & Hagen, E. H. (2021). Origins of music in credible signaling. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e60: 1-87.

### 2. Explain the Target's Argument

For each of the four elements below, do three things:

- **(a)** Explain it in your own words
- **(b)** Provide a supporting quotation with page number (more than one sentence is OK) <span class="smaller-text">[:Why both paraphrase and quotation?](#x-why-both)</span>
- **(c)** State whether the article's meaning seems clear or unclear. If unclear, explain what's not clear about it (e.g. "The article doesn't explain if they are saying that X explains only some Ys or every Y").

**Element 1: Phenomenon**

What phenomenon does the target article claim to explain? Be specific about what the authors are trying to account for.

**Element 2: Mechanism**

What explanation or mechanism does the target propose? How does the target say the phenomenon works or why it exists?

**Element 3: Evidence**

What main evidence or reasoning supports the target's explanation? What do the authors point to as support for their claims?

**Element 4: Contribution**

What do the target authors claim is new or different about their approach compared to existing theories?

## Guidelines

### Writing Your Explanations

Your own-words explanations should demonstrate understanding, not just reword the source. I'm looking for explanations that could help someone unfamiliar with the article understand the concept.

**Example of weak explanation (rewording):**
> "The authors argue that the film _Snake Attack at NUSC_ is scary because humans have an evolved predisposition to fear snakes, which is an adaptation from our ancestral environment, where snakes posed a significant threat to survival."

This weak example uses the article's language ("evolved predisposition," "adaptive," "ancestral environment") without explaining the underlying logic. You don't really need to understand the article's argument to produce this example.

**Example of strong explanation (demonstrating understanding):**
> "The authors argue that the film _Snake Attack at NUSC_ is scary because humans have an evolved predisposition to fear snakes. This trait, they argue, evolved because our ancestors who feared snakes were less likely to be bitten and thus more likely to survive and have children. The fear was thus fitness-enhancing, and their children, who inherited their fear, were more likely to reproduce, and the fear because a universal human trait. Thus, viewers who see snakes in the film fear them almost as a reflex."

This strong example names the phenomenon (film is scary), the mechanism that explains the phenomenon (fear of snakes), and how this mechanism causes the phenomenon.

If you find yourself unable to explain something in your own words, that's useful information—note it as an ambiguity rather than guessing. It's better to acknowledge confusion now than to build later work on a shaky foundation.

### Selecting Quotations

Choose quotations that directly support your explanation. Brief quotations (1-2 sentences) are usually more useful than long passages. Include page numbers so I can locate the passage if needed.

### Noting Clarity or Ambiguity

For each element, state whether the article's meaning seems clear or unclear to you. It's fine if most elements are clear—that's useful information too.

If something is unclear, ambiguities might include:

- Terms the article uses without defining
- Claims that could mean different things
- Scope that isn't clearly specified (e.g., does the article claim this is always true, usually true, or sometimes true?)

Identifying ambiguities isn't a sign of failure—it's valuable preparation for later assignments where you'll need to pin down exactly what the target claims.

### Building Toward P05

Your understanding of the target article will inform your commentary selection in P05. A solid grasp of what the target claims makes it easier to identify which commentaries raise substantive criticisms versus tangential objections.

## Feedback

I'll provide brief feedback to guide any students who are on the wrong track back towards the correct approach.

##### :x Why both?

The quotation lets me see exactly what the article states without having to follow every student's in-text citations and look in the articles for the original. The paraphrase helps me see if you are correctly interpreting what the quotation says.

##### :x Why gather these passages?

These passages become the raw material for P06, where you'll verify whether the commentary accurately represents what the target says. Gathering them now means you won't have to hunt for them later.
