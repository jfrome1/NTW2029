## Purpose

This assignment will develop your ability to explain complex academic arguments clearly and accurately. You'll practice charitable representation of source material, writing to your target audience, effective use of quotations, and clear attribution, which are essential skills for participating in academic conversations and for Paper 2.

## Overview

An expository paper explains someone else's argument in a way that is clearer and simpler than the original. Write a 1250-1750 word expository paper explaining arguments from Pinker's chapter "The Meaning of Life" about why humans enjoy art. The paper should explain both 1) his argument about why we enjoy art in general and 2) one or two of his specific arguments about why we enjoy a particular art form (visual arts, music, or narrative fiction). Write for a generalist, educated audience who hasn't read Pinker or taken this course.

:::caution[Critical: Answer the Right Question]
**This paper must answer "Why do humans ENJOY art?"**

NOT these questions:

- Why do we create art?
- Why do we spend time on art?
- What is art's social function?
- How does art affect status?

Papers addressing the wrong question or including off-topic content (status, creation, social functions) cannot receive grades higher than B regardless of writing quality.
:::

## Requirements

### Content

Your paper must explain exactly TWO things:

1. **Pinker's general argument**: Art enjoyment is a byproduct—it hijacks mental faculties that evolved for other survival purposes (pages 521-526)
2. **One or two specific mechanisms** for ONE art form you choose:
   - Visual arts (526-528)
   - Music (534-538)
   - Narrative fiction (538-543, avoiding tearjerker/benign masochism arguments)

**Exclude these topics completely** (even if Pinker mentions them):

- Art and status/prestige
- Why humans create art
- Art's social or cultural functions
- The general importance or value of art
- Music structure section (528-534)

### Structure

- **Introduction** (1-2 paragraphs): Must explain to your reader:
  1. Why art needs an evolutionary explanation (universality suggests biological basis)
  2. The puzzle: If traits evolve for survival/reproduction, why do humans enjoy "useless" art?
  3. Preview that Pinker argues art hijacks mental abilities evolved for other purposes
- **Thesis** (1-2 sentences max, highlighted yellow): Must answer "Why do humans enjoy [your chosen art form]?" and preview which specific mechanisms you'll explain
- **Body Part 1**: Explain Pinker's general byproduct argument
- **Body Part 2**: Explain 1-2 specific mechanisms for your chosen art form
- **Conclusion**: Brief restatement of main points

### Translation Requirements

**Never use these Pinker phrases without fully explaining them:**

- "hijacks mental faculties" → Explain WHICH specific faculty and HOW it gets hijacked
- "pleasure circuits" → Explain WHICH circuits and WHY they evolved
- "exploits/taps into the system" → Explain WHICH system and HOW the exploitation works
- "pleasure technology" → Explain the specific MECHANISM that creates pleasure
- "pleasure buttons" → Explain WHAT gets activated and WHY
- "pleasure-giving patterns" → Explain WHAT patterns and WHY they give pleasure
- "mental machinery" → Explain WHICH cognitive processes specifically

**Every abstract claim needs a concrete example:**

❌ **Bad (too abstract):** "Music exploits our pattern recognition abilities"

✓ **Good (concrete):** "Music creates pleasure when our brains, which evolved to detect patterns in nature for survival (like recognizing the rhythm of footsteps indicating a predator), automatically try to predict and decode the repeated melodies and rhythmic patterns in a song"

### Avoiding Circular Logic

**The #1 error: Circular explanations that don't actually explain anything**

❌ **Circular:** "We enjoy art because it gives us pleasure"
❌ **Circular:** "Art is pleasurable because it activates pleasure circuits"
❌ **Circular:** "We like beautiful things because beauty appeals to us"

✓ **Explanatory:** "We enjoy symmetrical faces because our brains evolved to use symmetry as a signal of genetic health when choosing mates"

**Test:** Can you add "because" after your explanation and then explain the mechanism? If not, revise.

### Formatting and Logistics

## Guidelines

### Introduction Patterns That Work

**Pattern A - Start with universality:**
"Every human culture, from prehistoric cave painters to contemporary digital artists, creates and enjoys visual art. This universality across time and geography suggests art appreciation has biological rather than purely cultural roots. Yet from an evolutionary perspective, this presents a puzzle..."

**Pattern B - Start with the evolutionary puzzle:**
"According to evolutionary theory, human traits persist because they helped our ancestors survive or reproduce. Yet humans universally spend significant time and resources enjoying art—activities that appear to serve neither purpose. Steven Pinker argues that this paradox resolves when we understand art as..."

**Avoid these ineffective openings:**

- Dictionary definitions of art
- Personal anecdotes about museum visits
- Broad claims about art's importance to society
- Jumping directly to "from a biological standpoint" without setup

### Depth Over Breadth Approach

For each mechanism you explain, include ALL of these elements:

1. **The original evolved function**: What problem did this mental faculty solve for survival/reproduction?
2. **How it normally works**: What triggers it in nature and why?
3. **How art "hijacks" it**: What specific features of art trigger this same response?
4. **Why this produces pleasure**: What is the causal chain from stimulus to enjoyment?

**Example of sufficient depth for ONE mechanism:**

"Pinker argues that landscape paintings trigger pleasure by exploiting habitat selection preferences that evolved in the African savanna. Our ancestors who felt drawn to landscapes with water sources, climbable trees, and open views with hidden spots survived better because these environments provided resources and safety. When we view paintings featuring these elements—rolling hills, scattered trees, and water—our brains respond as if we've found an ideal habitat, triggering the same reward signals that once motivated our ancestors to settle in survival-friendly locations. This explains why landscape paintings across cultures often share these features, even when painted by artists who never experienced a savanna."

### Common Pitfalls - Expanded

**Writing the wrong paper:**

- Writing a general summary of Pinker's chapter instead of focused explanation
- Discussing everything Pinker mentions instead of selected arguments
- Including his discussion of status (which answers a different question)

**Missing the "why":**

- Stating Pinker's conclusions without explaining his reasoning
- Saying THAT something is pleasurable without explaining WHY
- Using Pinker's metaphors ("hijacks," "exploits") as if they're explanations

**Being too vague:**

- "Patterns" without specifying visual, auditory, rhythmic, etc.
- "It stimulates the brain" without explaining which part and how
- "Mental faculties" without identifying which ones

**Attribution problems:**

- Not distinguishing your examples from Pinker's
- Using "I" when explaining Pinker's arguments
- Unclear pronoun references ("This shows..." "It argues...")

### Using Sources Effectively

- Start paragraphs with claims, not quotes
- Use quotes as evidence for your explanations, not as explanations themselves
- Maximum quote length: one sentence (prefer shorter)
- Every quote needs a lead-in and follow-up explanation
- Distinguish your examples: "To illustrate Pinker's point, consider..." (your example) vs. "Pinker uses the example of..." (his)

## Instructions

### Paper Development Process

1. **Understand the arguments**: Read Pinker multiple times, identifying:
   - His main question: "Why do humans enjoy art?"
   - His general answer: byproduct that hijacks evolved faculties
   - His specific mechanisms for each art form

2. **Choose your focus**:
   - Select ONE art form section
   - Identify 1-2 mechanisms within that section
   - Ensure you understand the complete causal chain for each

3. **Draft strategically**:
   - Start with an outline showing logical steps, not just conclusions
   - Write your introduction last (after you understand what you're introducing)
   - Explain each mechanism fully before moving to the next
   - Use your own words, translating Pinker's jargon

4. **Submission stages**:
   - **P01** (optional): Submit drafted material for early feedback
   - **P02**: Complete draft for conference discussion
   - **Conference**: Individual meeting for detailed feedback
   - **P03**: Final paper incorporating conference feedback

### Pre-Submission Checklist

**Central Question Test:**

- [ ] Does your thesis answer "Why do humans enjoy [art form]?" not other questions?
- [ ] Have you excluded ALL discussion of creation, status, or social functions?

**Circular Logic Test:**

- [ ] Can you add "because" after each explanation and then explain further?
- [ ] Search for "pleasure"—is each instance explained mechanistically?

**Depth Test:**

- [ ] For each mechanism, did you explain: original function, normal triggers, how art hijacks it, why this creates pleasure?
- [ ] Could someone who knows nothing about evolution understand your explanation?

**Translation Test:**

- [ ] Highlight every Pinker term—is each one explained in different words?
- [ ] Do you have concrete examples for all abstract claims?

**Attribution Test:**

- [ ] Is every claim from Pinker marked with signal verbs?
- [ ] Are your examples clearly distinguished from Pinker's?

## Feedback

You will receive feedback on your draft during your conference, and a letter grade with brief comments on strengths and weaknesses on the final paper.

## FAQs

### What do you mean by "drafted material"?

Drafted material means writing in full sentences and paragraphs (not notes or bullet points). It doesn't need perfect grammar or a complete structure. You can submit isolated paragraphs focusing on the sections you find most challenging.

### Can I analyze or critique Pinker's arguments?

Focus primarily on explanation. You may identify gaps or ambiguities in Pinker's argument if they genuinely interfere with explanation, but don't evaluate whether he's correct or propose alternative theories. Save analysis for your conference—if your instructor encourages it there, you can add it to the final version.

### How many quotations should I use?

There's no magic number. Use quotes when: 1) establishing credibility that you've read carefully, 2) capturing Pinker's specific terminology before explaining it, 3) providing evidence for your interpretation. Most paragraphs might have 1-2 short quotes or quoted phrases. Never let quotes do your explaining for you.

### What if Pinker's argument doesn't make sense to me?

First, assume it makes sense and you're missing something. Re-read, focusing on implicit connections. If confusion persists after multiple readings, you might have found a genuine ambiguity or gap—this can become part of your paper if you can articulate exactly what's unclear and why it matters for understanding the argument.
