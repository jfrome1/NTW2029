## Purpose

This paper develops your ability to identify and analyze scholarly disagreements in academic conversations. You'll learn how different interpretations of evidence lead to different conclusions and practice evaluating what's at stake in theoretical debates within evolutionary psychology.

## Overview

Write a 2250-2750 word paper that explains and analyzes one specific disagreement between a target article and one of its commentaries. You'll work with one of several provided articles from *Behavioral and Brain Sciences* (BBS), focusing on a limited aspect of the debate rather than the entire article.

## Requirements

### Source Requirements

Choose one target article and one commentary article from the provided options:

## Paper 2 Process

Paper 2 develops through six scaffolded assignments, each building specific analytical skills:

**[P04: Article Selection](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p04-article-selection/)** (Week 9, 200 words)
Choose your target article and commentary, then identify the main criticism you'll analyze. This focuses your attention on a manageable scope.

**[P05: Identify the Criticism](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p05-identify-disagreement/)** (Week 10)
Answer 7 questions mapping where and how the articles disagree. This prevents premature conclusions and ensures you're analyzing genuine disagreement.

**[P06: Explain Positions](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p06-explain-positions/)** (Week 10, 700-1000 words, conference)
Explain both positions neutrally without forming your thesis. This builds the foundation for analysis by ensuring accurate understanding.

**[P07: Working Draft](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p07-working-draft/)** (Week 11, 1200-1500 words, peer review)
Develop your thesis explaining why they reach different conclusions, with supporting analysis. This is where your own analytical thinking emerges.

**[P08: Full Draft](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p08-full-draft-and-outline/)** (Week 12, up to 2750 words, conference)
Add significance discussion explaining what your analysis contributes, plus required additional sources. This connects your work to broader academic conversation.

**[P09: Final Paper](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p09-final-draft/)** (Week 13, 2250-2750 words, graded)
Polish and finalize based on P08 conference guidance. See P09 for complete assessment framework and examples of what distinguishes stronger analysis.

## Assessment

All papers must include all core components. Paper quality is determined, in part, by the depth and sophistication with which you answer core questions about the disagreement. See P09 for details on assessment.

## Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. Read the target article for general understanding
2. Read available commentaries to identify interesting disagreements
3. Re-read your chosen passages, focusing on the disputed aspect
4. Map exactly where and how they disagree before writing

Focus on one specific aspect the commentary challenges—not the entire target article.

### Developing Your Analysis

This paper requires different thesis development than Paper 1. Your thesis should explain why these scholars reach different conclusions, not evaluate which position is stronger.

P07 provides detailed guidance on developing your thesis, including examples and diagnostic questions. Until then, focus on understanding both positions without forming conclusions about which is stronger.

### Structure

Your final paper should include:

- Include an introduction that orients readers to the disagreement and states your thesis
- Provide a target summary explaining the overall argument with focus on the disputed aspect
- Explain what the commentary challenges and why
- Analyze why these scholars reach different conclusions
- Discuss the significance of what your analysis contributes to the academic conversation
- Include a conclusion that synthesizes implications

These may be one or more paragraphs each, depending on your paper's needs.

## Feedback

You will receive conference feedback on P06 and P08. P09 receives a grade and written feedback. Conferences focus on what YOUR draft shows you're capable of and what specific guidance will strengthen your analysis.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About the Assignment

<!-- #### Why BBS format with pre-selected articles?

BBS articles include published commentaries that directly engage with the target's arguments. This gives you genuine scholarly disagreements to analyze rather than requiring you to find compatible sources yourself.

#### Can I change my article selection after P04?

Only if you discover during P05 or P06 that your chosen pairing doesn't have enough substantive disagreement. Consult with instructor before switching.
 -->
### What if I can't find enough disagreement in my chosen pairing?

Don't assume that you picked a bad article or need to switch. Often, students who are not used to this sort of assignment think they've reached a dead end when, in fact, they have found exactly the place where deeper analysis might start.

<!-- #### How is Paper 2 different from Paper 1?

P1 developed your own argument about a topic. P2 analyzes someone else's disagreement to understand why scholars reach different conclusions.
 -->
### About Sources

<!-- #### Do all commentaries count as sources or just my chosen one?

Only your chosen commentary counts as one of your required sources. If you examine additional commentaries for depth, those count as additional sources.

 -->
### What counts as an "additional source" beyond target/commentary/response?

Any academic source that helps you understand concepts, evaluate claims, or provide disciplinary context. Sources must be from reputable academic publishers, and can include research cited in the commentary, theoretical background, or empirical studies.

### How many sources is too many?

There's no maximum, but keep focus on analyzing your chosen disagreement. Sources should support that analysis, not expand into new territory.

<!-- ### About Process

#### Why so many scaffolding assignments?

Each assignment builds specific skills: P04 focuses selection, P05 maps disagreement structure and verifies significance, P06 develops neutral explanation, P07 adds thesis explaining why they differ plus supporting analysis, P08 adds required significance discussion and sources.

#### What happens if I do poorly on P06—can I still succeed on P09?

Yes. The P06 conference identifies what needs strengthening. P07-P08 give you opportunities to develop those areas.

#### Can I get feedback between P07 and P08?

You get peer review after P07 and can request additional guidance via email or office hours.

#### How much should I revise between drafts?

Ideally, you'll be able to revise every time you receive feedback from me or your peers, but I understand that's not always possible.
 -->
### About Requirements

### Does word count include references?

Word count includes in-text citations but excludes the reference list.

### What if my paper is under/over word count?

There is no set penalty, but aim to stay within the allowed range, as expectations for depth of discussion are based on a paper of that length.

### How many quotes should I use?

Follow guidance provided in class discussion and notes about when to quote. Don't put quotations in without purpose. When discussing what the articles say, quote enough key claims and phrases to build credibility with your reader. Quotations are most important if discussing nuanced aspects of language that are central to your discussion, such as whether or not the target really said what the commentary suggests it says. In those cases, quotations are evidence supporting your claims.

### About Paper Depth

### What's the difference between basic requirements and deeper analysis?

All papers must include all core components (explanation, thesis explaining why they differ, supporting analysis, significance discussion). Deeper analysis means more sophisticated insights about why they reach different conclusions, not additional sections. See P09 for detailed guidance.

##### :x how to write target summary

Provide an accurate summary of the target article's overall argument with focus on the aspect your chosen commentary challenges. Your summary should give readers enough context to understand what the commentary responds to without explaining the entire article.

Focus on accuracy and relevance. Include only what readers need to understand the specific disagreement you're analyzing.

##### :x understanding the commentary

Explain accurately what the commentary challenges in the target's argument, whether explicitly stated or implicitly assumed. This requires identifying:

- What specific claim, method, definition, or assumption the commentary questions
- Why the commentary sees this as problematic
- What alternative the commentary proposes (if any)

Accuracy matters more than comprehensiveness. Focus on the specific criticism you're analyzing rather than summarizing the entire commentary.

##### :x developing your thesis

Your thesis must explain why these scholars reach different conclusions. It should identify a specific difference (which definition, method, standard, or assumption differs), state what each version is, and explain how that difference produces different conclusions.

Your thesis should explain why they reach different conclusions. At minimum, accurately identify what explicit difference (definitional, methodological, evidentiary) drives the disagreement. More developed analysis examines trade-offs, implications, and consequences of each position—what's gained and lost with each approach, what each enables or constrains, what assumptions each requires.

P07 provides detailed guidance on developing your thesis, including examples and diagnostic questions. Until P07, focus on understanding both positions without forming conclusions about which is stronger.

##### :x writing significance discussion

Your significance discussion should reveal why understanding this incompatibility matters. Depending on your thesis, this might address: what resolving the disagreement would require, what becomes unclear or unresolvable, what the disagreement reveals about different approaches to the phenomenon, or what's at stake if the criticism were accepted.

See P08 assignment for detailed guidance, examples of strong vs weak significance discussions, and placement guidance.

##### :x supporting your thesis

Support your thesis with analysis using specific evidence and reasoning. Your analysis should:

- Use specific evidence from both articles
- Show how the difference you identified drives the disagreement
- Explain the logical connections between differences and conclusions
- Avoid simply asserting one side is correct

Stronger analysis often addresses questions like: What theoretical goals make different approaches useful? What would it take to resolve this disagreement? How do methodological commitments constrain possible conclusions?
