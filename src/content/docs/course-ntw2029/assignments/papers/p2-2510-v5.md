## Purpose

This paper develops your ability to identify and analyze scholarly disagreements in academic conversations. You'll learn how different interpretations of evidence lead to different conclusions and practice evaluating what's at stake in theoretical debates within evolutionary psychology.

## Overview

Write a 2250-2750 word paper that explains and analyzes one specific disagreement between a target article and one of its commentaries. You'll work with one of several provided articles from *Behavioral and Brain Sciences* (BBS), focusing on a limited aspect of the debate rather than the entire article.

## Requirements

### Source Requirements

Choose one target article and one commentary article from the provided options:

**Target Article Options:**

- Dubourg, E., & Baumard, N. (2022). Why imaginary worlds? The psychological foundations and cultural evolution of fictions with imaginary worlds. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e276. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X21000923  [download](/downloads/dubourgWhyImaginaryWorlds2022.pdf)

- Download both music articles and commentaries in one file: [download](/downloads/savage-mehrMusicEvolution.pdf)

Use at least four sources total: the target article, the commentary, the author's response (if applicable), plus at least one additional academic source.

### Content Requirements

All papers must provide:

- **Target summary:** Provide an accurate summary of the target article's overall argument
- **Commentary explanation:** Explain accurately what the commentary challenges in the target's argument (whether explicitly stated or implicitly assumed)
- **Thesis:** State a thesis that explains why these scholars reach different conclusions. Your thesis must identify a specific explicit difference (which definition, method, or standard differs), state what each version is, and explain how that difference produces different conclusions
- **Analysis:** Support your thesis with analysis using specific evidence and reasoning
- **Significance:** Discuss one specific, concrete consequence of the identified difference for the academic conversation by naming what becomes difficult, unclear, or unresolvable

Your thesis should explain why they reach different conclusions. Don't argue that one scholar is right and the other is wrong. Instead, describe the consequences or implications of each article's position.

*For detailed guidance on developing your thesis and understanding what distinguishes stronger analysis, see the P07 and P09 assignment pages.*

### Length and Format

- Follow all standard paper formatting requirements
- Include proper in-text citations and References section
- Highlight thesis in yellow (2 sentences max)
- Highlight topic sentences in body paragraphs in light blue

## Paper 2 Process

Paper 2 develops through a scaffolded sequence:

- **P04: Article Selection** (Week 9) - Choose articles and identify the main criticism you'll analyze (200 words)
- **P05: Identify the Criticism** (Week 10) - Answer 7 questions mapping the criticism and verifying significance (no word limit)
- **P06: Explain Positions** (Week 10) - Explain both positions neutrally without analysis or thesis (700-1000 words, conference)
- **P07: Working Draft** (Week 11) - Add thesis explaining why they reach different conclusions, plus supporting analysis (1200-1500 words, peer review)
- **P08: Full Draft** (Week 12) - Add required significance discussion and sources (up to 2750 words, conference)
- **P09: Final Paper** (Week 13) - Final polished paper (2000-2500 words, graded)

See individual assignment pages for detailed instructions. P07 provides guidance on developing your thesis. P09 contains the assessment framework and examples of what distinguishes stronger analysis.

## Assessment

All papers must include all core components. Paper quality is determined, in part, by the depth and sophistication with which you answer core questions about the disagreement. See P09 for details on assessment.

## Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. Read the target article for general understanding
2. Read available commentaries to identify interesting disagreements
3. Re-read your chosen passages, focusing on the disputed aspect
4. Map exactly where and how they disagree before writing

Focus on one specific aspect the commentary challenges—not the entire target article.

### Developing Your Analysis

This paper requires different thesis development than Paper 1. Your thesis should explain why these scholars reach different conclusions, not evaluate which position is stronger.

P07 provides detailed guidance on developing your thesis, including examples and diagnostic questions. Until then, focus on understanding both positions without forming conclusions about which is stronger.

### Structure

All papers should include:

- Include an introduction that orients readers to the disagreement and states your thesis
- Provide a target summary explaining the overall argument with focus on the disputed aspect
- Explain what the commentary challenges and why
- Analyze why these scholars reach different conclusions
- Discuss the significance of what your analysis contributes to the academic conversation
- Include a conclusion that synthesizes implications

These may be one or more paragraphs each, depending on your paper's needs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About the Assignment

#### Why BBS format with pre-selected articles?

BBS articles include published commentaries that directly engage with the target's arguments. This gives you genuine scholarly disagreements to analyze rather than requiring you to find compatible sources yourself.

#### Can I change my article selection after P04?

Only if you discover during P05 or P06 that your chosen pairing doesn't have enough substantive disagreement. Consult with instructor before switching.

#### What if I can't find enough disagreement in my chosen pairing?

This suggests you need to understand the positions more deeply. During P06 conference, we'll identify where the real disagreement lies.

#### How is Paper 2 different from Paper 1?

P1 developed your own argument about a topic. P2 analyzes someone else's disagreement to understand why scholars reach different conclusions.

### About Sources

#### Do all commentaries count as sources or just my chosen one?

Only your chosen commentary counts as one of your required sources. If you examine additional commentaries for depth, those count as additional sources.

#### What counts as an "additional source" beyond target/commentary/response?

Any academic source that helps you understand concepts, evaluate claims, or provide disciplinary context. Can include research cited in the commentary, theoretical background, or empirical studies.

#### Can I use sources the commentary cites?

Yes—especially if you're evaluating whether cited research actually supports the commentary's claims.

#### How many sources is too many?

No maximum, but keep focus on analyzing your chosen disagreement. Sources should support that analysis, not expand into new territory.

### About Analysis

#### What's the difference between explanation and analysis?

Explanation describes what each position argues. Analysis identifies why they reach different conclusions—the assumptions, definitions, or commitments that drive their different positions.

#### What should my thesis do?

Your thesis should explain why these scholars reach different conclusions. It must identify a specific explicit difference (which definition, method, or standard differs), state what each version is, and explain how that difference produces different conclusions. See P07 for examples and detailed guidance.

#### Am I supposed to pick a side?

Not required. Your thesis should explain why they reach different conclusions. Don't argue that one scholar is right and the other is wrong. Instead, describe the consequences or implications of each article's position. In P08-P09, you may discuss limitations if your analysis supports it, but the core task throughout is explanation.

#### What if I agree with both the target and commentary?

Then your analysis should explain what allows both to be correct—different frameworks, different questions, different evidence standards.

### About Process

#### Why so many scaffolding assignments?

Each assignment builds specific skills: P04 focuses selection, P05 maps disagreement structure and verifies significance, P06 develops neutral explanation, P07 adds thesis explaining why they differ plus supporting analysis, P08 adds required significance discussion and sources.

#### What happens if I do poorly on P06—can I still succeed on P09?

Yes. P06 conference identifies what needs strengthening. P07-P08 give you opportunities to develop those areas.

#### Can I get feedback between P07 and P08?

You get peer review after P07 and can request additional guidance via email or office hours.

#### How much should I revise between drafts?

Revise based on feedback received. P07→P08 typically adds new required content (significance discussion, sources). P08→P09 refines and strengthens based on conference guidance.

### About Requirements

#### Does word count include references?

No. Word count is body text only (excludes references, title, headers).

#### What if my paper is under/over word count?

Under suggests incomplete development. Over suggests lack of focus or needed editing. Aim for range specified in assignment.

#### Do I need formal introduction/conclusion sections?

You need introductory content that orients readers and concluding content that synthesizes implications, but these don't require labeled sections.

#### How many quotes should I use?

Use quotes for specific claims you're analyzing. Don't overquote—most content should be paraphrase and analysis.

### About Grading

#### Where can I find the assessment framework?

See P09 for the assessment framework, which describes Understanding (30%), Analysis (40%), Significance (20%), and Clarity (10%) with examples of what distinguishes different performance levels.

#### What's the difference between basic requirements and deeper analysis?

All papers must include all core components (explanation, thesis explaining why they differ, supporting analysis, significance discussion). Deeper analysis means more sophisticated insights about why they reach different conclusions, not additional sections. See P09 for detailed guidance.

#### How can I strengthen my analysis?

See P09 for detailed guidance on questions that support deeper analytical work.

## Feedback

You will receive conference feedback on P06 (explanation) and P08 (full draft with significance). P09 receives a grade and written feedback. Use conferences to identify specific strengths and areas for development in your analysis.
