## Purpose

This assignment will develop your ability to explain complex academic arguments clearly and accurately. You'll practice charitable representation of source material, writing to your target audience, effective use of quotations, and clear attribution, which are essential skills for participating in academic conversations and for Paper 2.

## Overview

An expository paper explains someone else's argument in a way that is clearer and simpler than the original. Write a 1250-1750 word expository paper explaining arguments from Pinker's chapter "The Meaning of Life" about why humans enjoy art, both in general, and as the argument applies to the to a specific art form. Write for a generalist, educated audience who hasn't read Pinker or taken this course.

## Requirements

### Content

- Explain Pinker's general argument about why humans enjoy art (pages 521-526)
- Explain one or two specific arguments about ONE art form (your choice):
  - Visual arts (526-528)
  - Music (534-538)
  - Narrative fiction (538-543, avoiding tearjerker/benign masochism arguments)
  - Note: don't write about music structure (528-534). [:Why not?](#x-why-not-write-about-music-structure)
- Define key evolutionary terms your target audience won't know [:What terms will my audience know?](#x-what-terms-will-my-audience-know)

In choosing "one or two" arguments, note that each mechanism Pinker discusses is a separate argument; e.g. there are at least six different arguments about music (they're numbered). You are limited to one or two so you can explain them in depth.

### Structure

- **Introduction**: 1-2 paragraphs; we will discuss introduction structure in class
- **Thesis** (1-2 sentences max, highlighted yellow): State Pinker's answer about why humans enjoy art and preview which specific art form and mechanisms you'll discuss [:Examples of weak vs strong theses](#x-examples-of-weak-vs-strong-theses)
- **Body Part 1**: Explain Pinker's general argument
- **Body Part 2**: Explain 1-2 specific mechanisms for your chosen art form
- **Conclusion**: Brief restatement of main points

I separated these for clarity, but don't use headers or subsections in your paper.

### Scope

The base expectation is clearly explaining Pinker's argument. Students whose explanations are in good shape by the conference may be invited to add analysis identifying ambiguities or limitations in Pinker's argument. Analysis is an optional "stretch goal" that should only be attempted if feedback indicates the explanation is quite far along.

Explain Pinker's argument about why people enjoy art, not [:other things he also writes about](#x-other-things-he-also-writes-about).

### Formatting and Logistics

Check the Course Information > Assignments page for these requirements.

### Process

- P01 (totally optional, not graded): Submit drafted material for early feedback [:What do you mean by "drafted material"?](#x-what-do-you-mean-by-drafted-material)
- P02: Submit complete draft for conference discussion
- Conference: Discuss draft feedback, ask questions
- E06: Submit conference report
- P03: Submit final paper

## Guidelines

### Explaining Pinker's Terms

Pinker uses figurative language that evokes meaning without fully explaining its meaning. If you quote or use his phrases, you must clearly explain their meaning in evolutionary terms [:Common phrases that need explanation](#x-phrases-that-need-explanation)

A common problem students face is assuming that sentences provide explanations just because they are in explanatory form ("X happens because of Y"). That's not always the case. To check, you must consider if X and Y are different enough that Y actually explains X rather than just restating it in different words.

- Circular: "We enjoy art because it gives us pleasure"
- Circular: "Art is enjoyable because it activates pleasure circuits"
- Circular: "We like beautiful things because beauty appeals to us"
- Explanatory: "We enjoy symmetrical faces because our brains evolved to use symmetry as a signal of genetic health when choosing mates"

### Key Considerations

- Attribution: Clearly distinguish your ideas and examples from Pinker's; don't leave it vague [:How to distinguish](#x-how-to-distinguish-examples)
- Explanation: Explain Pinker's reasoning, not just his conclusions
- Topic: Present an argument focus on why we enjoy art, not a general summary of Pinker's article as a whole
- Approach: Explain Pinker's theories, don't evaluate them or offer your own theories about why we enjoy art
- Clarity: Specify your referents ("This argument shows..."), don't use vague pronouns ("This shows...", "It means...)
- Number of mechanisms: Each art form discussion includes several mechanisms by which that art form creates enjoyment (according to Pinker). Explain one or two of these distinctly; don't blur several different mechanisms into one overall argument.

### Using Sources

- Use short quotes (less than a sentence) and quoted phrases (1-5 words) as evidence supporting your explanation
- Frame all short quotes (but not quoted phrases) with an introduction and explanation
- Maximum quote length: one sentence
- Cite page numbers for all paraphrases and quotes (e.g., (524-525))
- Include a reference list with your one source (Pinker)

## Feedback

You will receive feedback on your draft before and during your conference, and comments on strengths and weaknesses on the final paper.

## FAQs

### How many quotations should I use?

There's no magic number. Use quotes when: 1) establishing credibility that you've read carefully, 2) capturing Pinker's specific terminology before explaining it, 3) providing evidence for your interpretation. Most paragraphs might have 1-2 short quotes or quoted phrases. Never rely on quotations to do your explaining for you.

### What if Pinker's argument doesn't make sense to me?

Start charitably; assume it makes sense, and re-read, closely parsing the language to infer implicit assumptions and reasons. If confusion persists after multiple readings, you might have found a genuine ambiguity or gap (and those do exist). Explain the argument, explicitly noting any gaps or limitations, and if the explanation is solid by the conference, I'll invite you to analyze the argument, where you'll articulate exactly what's unclear and why it matters.

##### :x Examples of weak vs strong theses

- Weak thesis 1: "This paper will discuss Boyd's arguments about cooperation."
- Weak thesis 2: "Boyd has several arguments about how cooperation evolved."
- Weak thesis 3: "Boyd says that cooperation evolved and that reciprocal altruism is one reason."

Weak theses 1 and 2 describe Boyd's writing moves (what topics he discusses) rather than stating what he says about those topics. Weak thesis 3 mentions one reason supporting his conclusion, but doesn't preview the how the named mechanism works.

- Strong: "Boyd states that repeated interactions between people allowed the evolution of cooperation between non-kin. These repeated interactions, he argues, allowed an altruism strategy to enhance fitness more than a strategy of defection."

The strong thesis states Boyd's central claim (not just that he has one) and previews the specific mechanism the paper will explain.

##### :x How to distinguish examples

Pinker's ideas:

- "Pinker argues that..."
- "He reasons that..."

You ideas:

- "This concept is unclear..."
- "Although Pinker doesn't explain the connection, one argument supporting it is..."

Pinker's examples:

- "Pinker illustrates this idea with the example of..."
- "Pinker gives the example of..."

Your examples:

- "For instance, consider..."
- "To illustrate this, imagine..."

##### :x Why not write about music structure

Historically, students have had trouble writing effective papers on this section of the article (same issue with the arguments about tearjerkers and benign masochism). There are plenty of other good choices.

##### :x What terms will my audience know?

For this assignment assume your audience understands these basic terms and concepts: evolution, species, organism, trait, natural selection

You should _briefly_ explain the following terms if you use them: Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA), reproductive fitness, adaptation, byproduct

A brief explanation can be just one phrase in a sentence:

- Explaining "non-kin" - "Pinker says that altruism and cooperation eventually extended to non-kin (i.e. those with no familial or genetic relationship)."
- Explaining "social bonding": "Monkeys enhance social bonding, understood as their affinity for other monkeys, by grooming each other's fur."

##### :x What do you mean by drafted material?

Drafted material means writing in full sentences and paragraphs (not notes or bullet points). It doesn't need perfect grammar or a complete structure. You can submit isolated paragraphs focusing on sections you find challenging.

I don't want you to submit unorganized notes and ideas, which are difficult for me to understand well enough to provide useful feedback.

##### :x Phrases that need explanation

- "pleasure circuits" / "pleasure buttons"
- "pleasure technology"
- "mental machinery" / "mental faculties"
- "taps into the system"
- "pips of microsatisfaction"
- "auditory cheesecake"
- "tickle the sensitive spots"
- "defeat the locks"

##### :x Other things he also writes about

Only discuss these if they help explain Pinker's argument about why people enjoy art:

- Why the psychology of the arts is obscure
- How art is related to status
- Why faculties of the arts are elitist
- Why people think about philosophy and religion

If they are not needed to explain his main argument, then don't include them in your paper.
