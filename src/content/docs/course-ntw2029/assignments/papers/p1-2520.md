## Purpose

This assignment will develop your ability to explain complex academic arguments clearly and accurately. You'll practice charitable representation of source material, writing to your target audience, effective use of quotations, and clear attribution, which are essential skills for participating in academic conversations and for Paper 2.

## Overview

An expository paper explains someone else's argument in a way that is clearer and simpler than the original. Write a 1250-1750 word expository paper explaining arguments from Pinker's chapter "The Meaning of Life" about why humans enjoy art. The paper should explain both 1) his argument about why we enjoy art in general and 2) one or two of his specific arguments about why we enoy a particular art form (visual arts, music, or narrative fiction). Write for a generalist, educated audience who hasn't read Pinker or taken this course.

## Requirements

### Content

- Explain Pinker's general argument about why humans enjoy art (pages 521-526)
- Explain one or two specific arguments about ONE art form (your choice):
  - Visual arts (526-528)
  - Music (534-538)
  - Narrative fiction (538-543, avoiding tearjerker/benign masochism arguments)
- Define key evolutionary terms your target audience won't know    [:What terms will my audience know?](#x-what-terms-will-my-audience-know)

Note: don't write about music structure (528-534). [:Why not write about music structure?](#x-why-not-write-about-music)

 ### Structure

- **Introduction**: Follow the guidelines discussed in class
- **Thesis**: State Pinker's answer about why humans enjoy art and preview which specific arguments you'll discuss [:Examples of weak vs strong theses](#x-examples-of-weak-vs-strong-theses)
- **Body**: First explain general argument, then specific arguments for your chosen art form
- **Conclusion**: Brief restatement of main points

### Formatting and Logistics

Remember to check the Course Information / Assignments page for additional requirements.

## Guidelines

### Approach

- Remember the questions from our class discussion: What is Pinker's main question? What are the functions of his examples? What parts of the arguments are implicit?
- In choosing "one or two" arguments, note that each mechanism Pinker discusses is a separate argument; e.g. there are at least seven different arguments about music (they're numbered), and you would discuss only one or two so you can do so in-depth
- Focus only on arguments about why we enjoy art (not status or other topics)
- Review and apply the writing strategies covered in class

### Common Pitfalls

- Don't confuse Pinker's question about why humans _create_ art (not this paper's focus) with why humans _enjoy_ art (this paper's focus)
- Don't use Pinker's language, assuming that it's self-explanatory; he often uses terms like "pleasure technology" that require explication using totally different terms
- Don't blur different mechanisms into one vague argument
- Don't use terms like "patterns" without specifying what kind
- Don't mix your claims or examples with Pinker's without clarifying whose they are
- Don't attempt to evaluate whether Pinker is right (at most, identify gaps or points of confusion)
- Don't offer your own theories about why we enjoy art

### Using Sources

- Attribute every claim from Pinker using signal verbs (states, argues, claims)
- Use short quotes (less than a sentence) and quoted phrases (1-5 words) as evidence supporting your explanation and credibility
- Frame all short quotes (but not quoted phrases) with an introduction and explanation
- Use consistent keyterms throughout; (if Pinker doesn't, you can note this)
- Distinguish your examples from Pinker's [:How to make this distinction](#x-how-to-make-this-distinction)
- Cite page numbers for all paraphrases and quotes (e.g., (524-525), follow citation guidelines discussed in class)
- Include a reference list with your one source (Pinker)

## Instructions

### Paper Development Process

1. **Pre-writing** - take notes and draft ideas on your own
2. **P01** - option to submit drafted material [What do you mean by "drafted material"?](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p1-2510/#what-do-you-mean-by-drafted-material)
3. **P02 - Paper 1 draft** - complete, formatted version for conference feedback
4. **Paper 1 draft conference** - individual meeting to discuss draft
5. **P03 - Paper 1 final** - revised based on conference feedback

### Analysis Option

Focus on explanation. Only include analysis if your conference feedback explicitly encouraged it. If so, you may identify ambiguities or limitations in Pinker's argument, but don't evaluate whether he's correct or propose alternatives.

## Feedback

You will receive feedback on your draft during your conference, and a letter grade with brief comments on strengths and weaknesses on the final paper.

## FAQs

### What do you mean by drafted material?

Drafted material just means it's written in full sentences and paragraphs. It doesn't have to be fully revised or have perfect grammar. It can include isolated paragraphs without introductions or conclusions.

However, it should not include unedited notes, bullet point lists, or lists of questions for me to answer.

##### :x Examples of weak vs strong theses

Weak: "This paper will discuss Boyd's arguments about cooperation."
Weak: "Boyd has several arguments about how cooperation evolved."
Weak: "Boyd says that cooperation evolved and that reciprocal altruism is one reason."

Strong: "Boyd states that repeated interactions between people allowed the evolution of cooperation between non-kin. Due to this repetition, he argues, reciprocal altruism could  enhance fitness more than a strategy of defection."

##### :x How to make this distinction

When providing your own examples:

- "For instance, consider..." (your example)
- "To illustrate this, imagine..." (your example)
- "Pinker uses the example of..." (his example)

Take action to reduce ambiguity about whether an example comes from you or Pinker.

##### :x Why not write about music structure

Historically, students have had trouble writing effective papers on this section of the article (same issue with the arguments about tearjerkers and benign masochism). There are plenty of other good choices.

##### :x What terms will my audience know?

For this assignment assume your audience understands these basic terms and concepts: evolution, species, organism, trait, natural selection

You should _briefly_ explain the following terms if you use them: Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA), reproductive fitness, adaptation, byproduct,

A brief explanation can be just one phrase in a sentence: "Boyd says that altruism and cooperation eventually extended to non-kin (i.e. those with no familial or genetic relationship)." Or: "Monkeys enhance social bonding, understood as their affinity for other monkeys, by grooming each other's fur."
