## Purpose

This assignment will develop your ability to explain complex academic arguments clearly and accurately. You'll practice charitable representation of source material, writing to your target audience, effective use of quotations, and clear attribution, which are essential skills for participating in academic conversations and for Paper 2.

## Overview

An expository paper explains someone else's argument in a way that is clearer and simpler than the original. Write a 1250-1750 word expository paper explaining arguments from Pinker's chapter "The Meaning of Life" about why humans enjoy art. The paper should explain both 1) his argument about why we enjoy art in general and 2) one or two of his specific arguments about why we enjoy a particular art form (visual arts, music, or narrative fiction). Write for a generalist, educated audience who hasn't read Pinker or taken this course.

:::caution[Critical: Answer the Right Question]
**This paper must answer "Why do humans ENJOY art?"**

NOT these questions:

- Why do we create art?
- Why do we spend time on art?
- What is art's social function?
- How does art affect status?

Papers addressing the wrong question or including significant off-topic content (status, creation, social functions) are unlikely to receive grades higher than B.

## Requirements

### Content

Your paper must explain exactly TWO things:

1. **Pinker's general argument** that art enjoyment is a byproduct that "hijacks" mental faculties that evolved for other survival purposes (pages 521-526)
2. **One or two specific mechanisms** causing art enjoyment for ONE art form you choose:
   - Visual arts (526-528)
   - Music (534-538)
   - Narrative fiction (538-543, avoiding tearjerker/benign masochism arguments)

Don't write about the music structure section (528-534) or the narrative fiction tearjerker/benign masochism arguments, as these have not worked well in past papers.

**Exclude these topics completely** (even if Pinker mentions them):

- Art and status/prestige
- Why humans create art
- Art's social or cultural functions
- The general importance or value of art

### Structure

- **Introduction** - 1-2 paragraphs, we will discuss structure in class
- **Thesis** (1-2 sentences max, highlighted yellow): Must answer "Why do humans enjoy [your chosen art form]?" and preview which specific mechanisms you'll explain
- **Body Part 1**: Explain Pinker's general byproduct argument
- **Body Part 2**: Explain 1-2 specific mechanisms for your chosen art form
- **Conclusion**: Brief restatement of main points

### Explanation Requirements

Don't use Pinker's phrases without clearly explaining them. These phrases use figurative language to evoke a sense of their meanings, making them feel explanatory, but they must be tied back to more concrete evolutionary terminology.

- "pleasure circuits"
- "hijacks mental faculties"
- "taps into the system"
- "pleasure technology"
- "pleasure buttons"
- "mental machinery"
- "pips of microsatisfaction"
- "auditory cheesecake"

### Avoiding Circular Logic

The most common problem students face in explanations is assuming that sentences in explanatory form ("X happens because of Y") are explanations without reflecting deeply enough about what X and Y mean.

**Circular:** "We enjoy art because it gives us pleasure"
**Circular:** "Art is enjoyable because it activates pleasure circuits"
**Circular:** "We like beautiful things because beauty appeals to us"

**Explanatory:** "We enjoy symmetrical faces because our brains evolved to use symmetry as a signal of genetic health when choosing mates"

**Test:** Can you add another "because" after your explanation and then explain the mechanism? If not, you may not fully understand the actual reasons given in Pinker's argument.

### Formatting and Logistics

Remember to check the Course Information / Assignments page for additional requirements.

## Guidelines

### Common Pitfalls

- Writing a general summary of Pinker's opening section instead of a paper focused on your thesis
- Stating Pinker's conclusions without explaining his reasoning

- Not distinguishing your ideas and examples from Pinker's
- Distinguish your examples: "To illustrate Pinker's point, consider..." (your example) vs. "Pinker uses the example of..." (his)

- Unclear pronoun references ("This shows..." "It means...")

- Maximum quote length: one sentence
- Every quote needs a lead-in and follow-up explanation (mini-quotes excluded)


## Instructions

4. **Submission stages**:

   - **P01** (optional): Submit drafted material for early feedback
   - **P02**: Complete draft for conference discussion. After your draft, briefly describe: (a) questions you have about your draft, and (b) aspects you're having trouble with or feel uncertain about.
   - **Conference**: Individual meeting for detailed feedback
   - **P03**: Final paper incorporating conference feedback

## Feedback

You will receive feedback on your draft before and during your conference, and comments on strengths and weaknesses on the final paper.

## FAQs

### What do you mean by "drafted material"?

Drafted material means writing in full sentences and paragraphs (not notes or bullet points). It doesn't need perfect grammar or a complete structure. I don't want you to submit unorganized notes and ideas, which are difficult for me to understand well enough to provide useful feedback.

### Can I analyze or critique Pinker's arguments?

Focus primarily on explanation. You may identify gaps or ambiguities in Pinker's argument if they genuinely interfere with explanation, but don't evaluate whether he's correct or propose alternative theories. Save analysis for your conference—if your instructor encourages it there, you can add it to the final version.

### How many quotations should I use?

There's no magic number. Use quotes when: 1) establishing credibility that you've read carefully, 2) capturing Pinker's specific terminology before explaining it, 3) providing evidence for your interpretation. Most paragraphs might have 1-2 short quotes or quoted phrases. Never let quotes do your explaining for you.

### What if Pinker's argument doesn't make sense to me?

First, assume it makes sense and you're missing something. Re-read, focusing on implicit connections. If confusion persists after multiple readings, you might have found a genuine ambiguity or gap—this can become part of your paper if you can articulate exactly what's unclear and why it matters for understanding the argument.
