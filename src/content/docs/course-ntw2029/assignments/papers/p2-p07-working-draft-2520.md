## Purpose

This assignment develops your analytical contribution—your thesis about what underlies the disagreement between target and commentary. You'll practice formulating a thesis that "goes beneath" what either author explicitly states, then developing that thesis with specific evidence.

## Overview

Write a working draft (approximately 1200-1500 words) in the form of separate sections that you'll later combine in your full draft. Since you've verified the disagreement in P06, you can focus on developing your thesis and analysis rather than establishing basic understanding.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the headers below (keep numbering) into a document, writing your content under each heading.

### 1. Working Thesis

State what prevents these positions from being compatible. Your thesis should:

- Build on your verified understanding from P06
- Identify what drives the disagreement (an assumption, definition, methodological commitment, or evidentiary standard)
- Explain WHY the positions conflict, not just that they do

[:How to formulate your working thesis](#x-how-to-formulate-your-thesis)

### 2. "Going Beneath" Test

Search both articles for your key claim. Quote any passages where either author says something close to your thesis.

Then explain:

- If you find your thesis stated explicitly, you've described rather than analyzed. Revise to identify something neither author says outright.
- If your thesis names something implicit—an unstated assumption, an unacknowledged commitment, a pattern neither author identifies—explain what makes it implicit.

### 3. Analysis Development

Develop your thesis with specific evidence from both articles. Answer whichever diagnostic questions fit your case—most commentaries will match one or two patterns.

Your analysis should explain HOW the differences you identified in your thesis produce the logical conflict. Use quotations and specific evidence to support your claims.

[:Diagnostic patterns for analysis](#x-diagnostic-patterns)

### 4. Beginning Significance

Explain why understanding this disagreement matters. Address these questions:

- What becomes difficult or unresolvable because of this disagreement?
- What does the disagreement reveal about different approaches to studying this phenomenon?
- If this disagreement were resolved, what would that require or enable?

You'll develop significance more fully in P08, but beginning this thinking now will strengthen your analysis.

### 5. Source Identification

Provide a reference list that includes at least 2 additional sources beyond the target and commentary (you can include the author's response if you plan to cite it).

Below the reference list, write 1-2 sentences for each additional source explaining how it supports your analysis.

## Guidelines

### Building on P06

Your P06 conference verified whether the commentary accurately represents the target. P07 assumes that verification is complete:

- If you found a genuine disagreement, your thesis explains what drives it
- If you found over-reading, your thesis explains what the actual relationship is (which may still involve genuine disagreement about something different)

You don't need to repeat your verification evidence unless briefly needed for context.

### Don't Include an Introduction

You're still developing your thesis through analysis. An introduction requires framing a question you're answering, but that framing should emerge from your analysis. You'll write an introduction in P08 once your thesis has stabilized through peer review.

### Don't Evaluate Which Position Is Right

It's natural to form judgments about which position seems stronger. Hold that thought for P08. For P07, focus on explaining WHY they reach different conclusions—what assumptions, definitions, or evidence interpretations drive their disagreement.

### About Depth

What distinguishes stronger papers is the depth and sophistication of analysis past basic identification of disagreement.

For theoretical disagreements, depth often means:

- Identifying implicit assumptions that neither author states
- Recognizing structural features of frameworks that produce incompatibility
- Revealing what's theoretically at stake that neither author names

For empirical disagreements, depth often means:

- Examining what each treats as sufficient evidence
- Identifying patterns in evidence evaluation (burden of proof, handling ambiguity)
- Understanding what methodological commitments drive different conclusions from the same data

## Peer Review Focus

During peer review, you'll:

- Explain your thesis and how you arrived at it
- Get feedback on whether your thesis genuinely "goes beneath"
- Discuss what evidence best supports your analysis
- Explore how to develop significance

Your peers will help you think through:

- Is your thesis stated explicitly in either article? (If so, you need to go deeper)
- What evidence would strengthen your analysis?
- Why does understanding this disagreement matter?

## Feedback

You will not receive instructor feedback on P07. Instead, you'll get peer review to help you clarify your thinking before developing your draft into P08.

##### :x how to formulate your working thesis

Your working thesis should explain what prevents these positions from being compatible. Based on your P06 verification, your thesis will take one of these forms:

**If you found genuine disagreement:**

- "They genuinely disagree because [identify the definitional, methodological, or evidentiary difference]"
- "They agree on [explicit claims] but differ on [implicit assumption or framework commitment]"

**If you found over-reading:**

- "Their disagreement stems from [type of mischaracterization], but the underlying issue is [what the exchange reveals]"
- "The commentary criticizes a position stronger than what the target claims, but there's still genuine tension about [what remains once qualifiers are restored]"

Don't argue that one scholar is right and the other wrong. Instead, explain what drives the disagreement—the assumption, definition, or methodological commitment that produces the conflict.

##### :x how theses develop through p07-p08

For students interested in understanding the developmental process: Your thesis will likely evolve through stages. A changing thesis is expected, not a sign of problems.

**Starting point** (what P06 gave you):

- Understanding what each position argues
- Identifying the commentary's main criticism
- Verifying accuracy of the commentary's characterization

**P07 working thesis** (what analysis reveals):

- "They disagree because the target focuses on X while the commentary focuses on Y"
- "The apparent conflict stems from commentary's mischaracterization of Z"
- "They agree on explicit claims but differ on implicit assumption A"

**Deeper thesis** (develops in P08):

For theoretical/definitional disagreements, deeper theses often:

- Identify implicit assumptions or commitments neither author states
- Reveal structural constraints in theoretical frameworks
- Show why theoretical positions logically exclude each other

For empirical disagreements, deeper theses often:

- Reveal evidentiary standards and what each treats as sufficient proof
- Explain patterns in how data or predictions get evaluated differently
- Identify who bears burden of proof and why that matters
- Show what methodological commitments drive different interpretations

Your analysis determines which aspects matter for your case. You might address one of these or several, depending on what you discover.

Peer review will help you identify whether your working thesis explains what you discovered. Expect your thesis to change. What you develop in P07 is a working thesis that will likely be refined, deepened, or even reconceived as you work through P08.

##### :x why going beneath test matters

Students often state a thesis that one of the authors already says explicitly. If your thesis is "The commentary argues the target overlooks developmental factors," you've described the commentary, not analyzed the disagreement.

A thesis that "goes beneath" identifies something neither author states:

- **Description (not thesis):** "The commentary says the target's theory is too broad."
- **Thesis:** "Both assume that a theory of imaginary worlds should apply uniformly across ages, which obscures developmental differences that might require different explanatory mechanisms for children versus adults."

The second version names an assumption neither author explicitly identifies. That's your analytical contribution.

If you search both articles and find your claim stated explicitly, that's useful information—it means you need to dig deeper. What enables that explicit disagreement? What assumption would both authors need to accept for their positions to be compatible?

##### :x diagnostic patterns

Develop your thesis with specific evidence and reasoning. Answer whichever diagnostic questions fit your case—most commentaries will match one or two patterns. Your analysis should explain how these issues produce the incompatibility you identified in your thesis. Use specific evidence from both articles to develop your claims.

To identify why the positions reach different conclusions, answer whichever questions apply to your case. You don't need to answer questions that don't fit your disagreement:

- [:Pattern 1: Claims don't match evidence](#x-pattern-1)
- [:Pattern 2: Missing important factors](#x-pattern-2)
- [:Pattern 3: Definitions don't match](#x-pattern-3)
- [:Pattern 4: Wrong question or framework](#x-pattern-4)
- [:Pattern 5: Logical problems or scientific standards](#x-pattern-5)

##### :x pattern-1

**Pattern 1: Claims don't match evidence**

- Does the commentary show the target's prediction failed?
- Are there counterexamples to the target's universal claim?
- Does the target cherry-pick supporting cases while ignoring contradictory evidence?
- *Example: Verpooten & Eens argue that singing doesn't correlate with social complexity as predicted*

##### :x pattern-2

**Pattern 2: Missing important factors**

- What does the commentary say the target overlooked?
- Why does that missing factor matter for understanding the phenomenon?
- *Example: Goldstein argues that theatre lacks representational distance that target's theory requires*

##### :x pattern-3

**Pattern 3: Definitions don't match**

- Do target and commentary define key terms differently?
- If they used the commentary's definition, would the disagreement dissolve or remain?
- *Example: Norman defines "exploration" to include all non-real worlds, not just fantastical ones*

##### :x pattern-4

**Pattern 4: Wrong question or framework**

- Does the commentary say the target asked the wrong question?
- Does the commentary claim the target's approach can't work for this type of phenomenon?
- *Example: Killin argues adaptation/byproduct framework can't handle complex coevolved traits like music*

##### :x pattern-5

**Pattern 5: Logical problems or scientific standards**

- Does the commentary say the target's argument is circular or logically invalid?
- Does the commentary say the theory is too vague to test or makes no testable predictions?
- Does the commentary challenge what evidence threshold is needed (burden of proof, parsimony, defaults)?
- *Example: Stewart-Williams argues evidence is ambiguous between adaptation and byproduct; when evidence doesn't discriminate, the default should be simpler explanation*

##### :x what sources to identify

During P07, identify additional sources you'll need for P08:

- If the commentary cites research as evidence, find and begin reading that research to evaluate whether it supports what the commentary says
- If the commentary or author's response references other work by either author, locate those sources to see whether they clarify or complicate the criticism
- If you need to understand theoretical frameworks or technical concepts, find sources that explain them

List these sources with brief explanation of how each will support your analysis. Additional sources should help you evaluate THIS specific criticism—they should not introduce entirely new arguments or shift focus away from the disagreement between your target and commentary.
