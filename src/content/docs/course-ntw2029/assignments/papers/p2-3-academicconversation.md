Paper 2 starts with selecting a source to analyze. In this assignment, you will propose a main source to analyze in Paper 2.

You have two options for this assignment:

- Basic: Find and propose a main source for Paper 2 relating to EP and art.
- Optional (more work, better feedback): Identify an academic conversation relevant to EP and art. Identify at least two academic sources that are part of this conversation and that you might analyze for Paper 2. Describe the academic conversation your sources are engaged in and what they claim to have contributed to it. The description can be high-level (meaning you don't need to provide details of their arguments) but you must make clear how the two sources differ in their contributions. Don't worry about being completely accurate in your description. The main questions to answer are: What are sources in this conversation trying to explain? What do your sources agree and/or disagree about? At the end of this description, skip a line and state which of the sources you prefer to use  as your main focus for Paper 2.

In either case, I'll look at the sources, approve your source (or not) and you will use that source for the next part of the assignment, the Paper 2 source summary outline.and provide brief feedback to help you find a good source. To help me do that, at top of the assignment, provide the sources' [:full citation information](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/in-class/citations/#use-apa-formatting) as if in an APA reference list, including a [:DOI link](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/in-class/citations/#citation-urls). If the source does not have a URL (many books don't), please link to the source search result link at NUS libraries.

You can change your main source later if necessary, but I strongly recommend that you stay within the same basic topic area so you don't spend lots of time looking for the perfect text. Any source changes must be approved.

If you don't know where to start in looking for a source, you might read some literature reviews.

Below, I've listed a number of sources you can use to help find sources in the topic areas you are interested in.

Start looking for these at the NUS library website rather than general online searches. Ask an NUS librarian if you cannot access them through the library webpage. If you can't get them through the library in a timely manner, ask your tech savvy friends for a potential workaround.
