For this assignment, identify an academic conversation relevant to EP and art that is discussed in published academic sources. Identify at least 2 academic sources that are part of this conversation and that you might analyze for Paper 2.

It's best if I can take a glance at your sources before giving you feedback, so at the top of the assignment, provide their [:full citation information](#x-citation) as if in an APA reference list, including a link to the source on the webpage of the journal or press where it was originally published. If the source does not have a URL (many books don't), please link to the source search result link at NUS libraries.

Briefly describe the academic conversation and what your sources have contributed to it. The description can be high-level (meaning you don't need to provide details of their arguments) but you must make clear how the two sources differ in their contributions.

At the end of this description, skip a line and state which of the sources you discuss you prefer to use  as your main focus for Paper 2. Before you choose, review [:these guidelines](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-1-overview/#x-these-guidelines) again. I will approve the source (or not) and you will use that source for the next part of the assignment, the Paper 2 source summary outline.

:::warn
My approval means that I don't see any obvious problems with using your source, but I won't be able to read all of your sources closely at this point, so I cannot take responsibility for making sure the source will work well for Paper 2. That is your responsibility.
:::

You can change your main text later if necessary, but I strongly recommend that you stay within the same basic topic area so you don't spend lots of time looking for the perfect text. Any source changes must be approved.

Below, I've listed a number of sources you can use to help find sources in the topic areas you are interested in.

Start looking for these at the NUS library website rather than general online searches. Ask an NUS librarian if you cannot access them through the library webpage. If you can't get them through the library in a timely manner, ask your tech savvy friends for a potential workaround.

##### :x citation

You can review what counts as an academic source in the Paper 2 overview assignment.

Provide full citation information for each text and provide a link to the text, either to the full article or a link to the book on the publisher's website or the NUS library page.

## Literature reviews

Most research articles summarize previous research in their introductions, to provide context regarding what other people have said in the academic conversation, and this section of an article is often referred to as a literature review.

However, there are also sources that are entirely literature reviews; they generally do not propose and defend theses but simply provide overviews of research in an area. They can be useful for getting a sense of the types of research being done.

:::warn
Literature review sources are NOT appropriate as a primary source for Paper 2 because they do not (usually) propose and defend a thesis. They synthesize research to help readers get an overview of a field.
:::

You can often tell if a source is a literature review, even before you read it, by keeping an eye out for [:certain clues](#x-clues).

##### :x clues

Clues a source is a literature review:

- it is a chapter in an [:anthology](#x-anthology) or a [:handbook](#x-handbook)
- it presents no clear "they say" that the source is arguing against, or the "they say" is something like "some people might think" but doesn't include any arguments against what other scholars have published
- it lists a number of different theories about a topic but doesn't clearly defend a particular theory

##### :x anthology

Anthologies are books where each chapter is written by a different person. They have an editor (or editors), who often writes an introduction and/or a chapter of the book. The editor is responsible for editing the chapters and managing the project, and they are named on the front cover, e.g. "edited by Luicano Floridi". Chapters in anthologies are independent and are related only by general topic area. Anthology chapters are sometimes, but not always, literature reviews.

##### :x handbook

Handbooks are anthologies that aim to give researchers an overview of topics in a field, with each chapter about a different topic. Handbook chapters are almost always literature reviews.

Handbooks usually have words like "handbook", "guide to", and "companion to" in their titles, as well as a publisher's name, e.g.:

- _The Oxford handbook of philosophical methodology_
- _The Palgrave handbook of the philosophy of film and motion pictures_
- _The Routledge companion to video game studies_
- _The Routledge handbook of evolution and philosophy_
- _The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of computing and information_

## Texts relevant to specific topic areas:

You can choose one of these texts as your primary source (no promises from me that they will work for you; you are responsible for making sure the source is suitable for your paper) or use them as a starting place to find related sources. I have put a @ in front of sources that other students have already written about in previous terms, so for those I suggest that you take them as a starting place for your search and use them to find related sources. Avoid using an article with "review" in the title as your main source as it is likely a literature review (exceptions exist).
