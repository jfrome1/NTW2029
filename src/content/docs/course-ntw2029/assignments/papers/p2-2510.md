## Purpose

This paper develops your ability to identify and analyze scholarly disagreements in academic conversations. You'll learn how different interpretations of evidence lead to different conclusions and practice evaluating what's at stake in theoretical debates within evolutionary psychology.

## Overview

Write a 2250-2750 word paper that explains and analyzes one specific disagreement between a BBS target article and one of its commentaries. You'll work with one of four provided target articles, focusing on a limited aspect of the debate rather than the entire article. Your paper will explain both positions, analyze the nature of their disagreement, and (if possible) discuss its implications for the field.

## Requirements

### Source Requirements

Choose one of these target articles and one commentary article:

## Paper 2 Process

Paper 2 develops through six scaffolded assignments, each building specific analytical skills:

**[P04: Article Selection](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p04-article-selection/)**
Choose your target article and commentary, then identify the main criticism you'll analyze. This focuses your attention on a manageable scope.

**[P05: Identify the Criticism](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p05-identify-disagreement/)**
Answer 7 questions mapping where and how the articles disagree. This prevents premature conclusions and ensures you're analyzing genuine disagreement.

**[P06: Explain Positions](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p06-explain-positions/)**
Explain both positions neutrally without forming your thesis. This builds the foundation for analysis by ensuring accurate understanding.

**[P07: Working Draft](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p07-working-draft/)**
Develop your thesis explaining why they reach different conclusions, with supporting analysis. This is where your own analytical thinking emerges.

**[P08: Full Draft and Outline](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-p08-full-draft-and-outline/)**
Add significance discussion, topic sentence outline, plus required additional sources. This connects your work to broader academic conversation.

**P09: Final Paper**
Polish and finalize based on P08 conference guidance. See P09 for complete assessment framework and examples of what distinguishes stronger analysis.

## Guidelines

<!-- ### Getting Started

1. Read the target article for general understanding
2. Read available commentaries to identify interesting disagreements
3. Re-read your chosen passages, focusing on the disputed aspect
4. Map exactly where and how they disagree before writing

Focus on one specific aspect the commentary challenges—not the entire target article. -->

### Developing Your Analysis

This paper requires different thesis development than Paper 1. Your thesis should explain why these scholars reach different conclusions, not evaluate which position is stronger.

P07 provides detailed guidance on developing your thesis, including examples and diagnostic questions. Until then, focus on understanding both positions without forming conclusions about which is stronger.

## Assessment

All papers must include all core components: explanation of both positions, analytical thesis about why they reach different conclusions, supporting analysis, and significance discussion.

### Performance Levels

**Foundational**: Accurately explain both positions using specific textual evidence. Identify where they explicitly disagree.

**Strong**: Also analyze what drives the disagreement—the assumptions, definitions, or methodological commitments that produce different conclusions.

**Sophisticated**: Also evaluate what understanding this incompatibility contributes to the academic conversation.

**Note**: Accurate comprehension of both positions is prerequisite for analysis. If you struggle to explain what each position claims using your own words with textual support, focus on comprehension before attempting analytical thesis development.

See P09 for more detailed guidance on what distinguishes sophisticated analysis.

## Feedback

You will receive conference feedback on P06 and P08. P09 receives a grade and written or recorded feedback.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About the Assignment

#### What if I can't find enough disagreement in my chosen pairing?

Don't assume that you picked a bad article or need to switch. Often, students who are not used to this sort of assignment think they've reached a dead end when, in fact, they have found exactly the place where deeper analysis might start.

### About Sources

#### What counts as an "additional source" beyond target/commentary/response?

Any academic source that helps you understand concepts, evaluate claims, or provide disciplinary context. Sources must be from reputable academic publishers, and can include research cited in the commentary, theoretical background, or empirical studies.

#### How many sources is too many?

There's no maximum, but keep focus on analyzing your chosen disagreement. Sources should support that analysis, not expand into new territory.

### About Requirements

#### Does word count include references?

Word count includes in-text citations but excludes the reference list.

#### What if my paper is under/over word count?

There is no set penalty, but aim to stay within the allowed range, as expectations for depth of discussion are based on a paper of that length.

#### How many quotes should I use?

Follow guidance provided in class discussion and notes about when to quote. Don't put quotations in without purpose. When discussing what the articles say, quote enough key claims and phrases to build credibility with your reader. Quotations are most important if discussing nuanced aspects of language that are central to your discussion, such as whether or not the target really said what the commentary suggests it says. In those cases, quotations are evidence supporting your claims.

### About Paper Depth

#### What's the difference between basic requirements and deeper analysis?

All papers must include all core components (explanation, thesis explaining why they differ, supporting analysis, significance discussion). Deeper analysis means more sophisticated insights about why they reach different conclusions, not additional sections. See P09 for detailed guidance.

##### :x How to Write Target Summary

Provide an accurate, general summary of the target article's overall argument. Focus on the aspect your chosen commentary challenges. Provide only the details needed to give readers the context to understand the general academic conversation, the specific disagreement you're discussing, and your thesis.

##### :x Understanding the Commentary

Explain accurately what the commentary challenges in the target's argument, whether explicitly stated or implicitly assumed. This requires identifying:

- What specific claim, method, definition, or assumption the commentary questions
- Why the commentary sees this as problematic
- What alternative the commentary proposes (if any)

Accuracy matters more than comprehensiveness. Focus on the specific criticism you're analyzing, and don't worry about including everything the target article spends time on.

##### :x Developing Your Thesis

Your thesis should identify both the disagreement and what drives it—whether explicit differences in definitions, implicit assumptions, structural constraints neither author names, or something else. More developed analysis examines what each position enables or constrains, what's gained and lost with each approach, and what assumptions each requires.

##### :x Writing Significance Discussion

Your significance discussion should reveal why understanding this incompatibility matters. Depending on your thesis, this might address: what resolving the disagreement would require, what becomes unclear or unresolvable, what the disagreement reveals about different approaches to the phenomenon, or what's at stake if the criticism were accepted.

See P08 assignment for detailed guidance, examples of strong vs weak significance discussions, and placement guidance.

##### :x Supporting Your Thesis

Supporting an analytical thesis means demonstrating the connection you identified. If your thesis claims different definitions drive the disagreement, show textual evidence of each definition and trace how each produces different conclusions about the same phenomenon. If your thesis identifies implicit assumptions, show where each position requires that assumption and what becomes impossible without it.

If (and only if) you have effectively addressed these issues, move on to consequences for the academic conversation: What does each position enable or constrain? What trade-offs does each approach make? What would it take to resolve this disagreement—and what would be lost in the resolution?
