## Purpose

This paper develops your ability to identify and analyze scholarly disagreements in academic conversations. You'll learn how different interpretations of evidence lead to different conclusions and practice evaluating what's at stake in theoretical debates within evolutionary psychology.

## Overview

Write a 2250-2750 word paper that explains and analyzes one specific disagreement between a BBS target article and one of its commentaries. You'll work with one of four provided target articles, focusing on a limited aspect of the debate rather than the entire article. Your paper will explain both positions, analyze the nature of their disagreement, and (if possible) discuss its implications for the field.

## Requirements

### Source Requirements

Choose one of these target articles and one commentary article:

- Dubourg, E., & Baumard, N. (2022). Why imaginary worlds? The psychological foundations and cultural evolution of fictions with imaginary worlds. _Behavioral and Brain Sciences_, 45, e276. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X21000923  [download](/downloads/dubourgWhyImaginaryWorlds2022.pdf)

- Menninghaus, W., Wagner, V., Hanich, J., Wassiliwizky, E., Jacobsen, T., & Koelsch, S. (2017).

Use at least two other reputable academic sources (as explained in class) to complement your main sources

### Content Requirements

- Explain the target article's main argument
- Identify and explain the specific disagreement
- Analyze the nature of the disagreement (evidence interpretation, assumptions, definitions, or methods)
- (Optional) discuss implications, significance, or contribute to the academic conversation in other ways (details explained in class)

### Structure Requirements

- Introduction: Orient reader and state thesis
- Body Section 1: Target article's argument
- Body Section 2: Commentary's disagreement
- Body Section 3: Analysis of disagreement
- Body Section 4 (optional): Implications
- Conclusion: Summarize disagreement and analysis

These sections may be one or more paragraphs each, depending on the needs of the particular essay.

## Guidelines

### Grading Expectations

- **Basic** - accurately explain both positions and identify the explicit disagreement
- **Good** - also analyze (potentially implicit) aspects of why the authors disagree (assumptions, definitions, methods, etc.)
- **Better** - also evaluate the significance of the disagreement for the academic conversation
- **Stretch goal** - also add to the conversation with original insights (e.g., dissolve disagreement by analyzing implicit assumptions)

(additional details and guidelines to be posted)

<!-- p2 - do I want your original ideas?
	p2 should include your original ideas about things mentioned in your main source
	p2 should not include original theories you come up with to answer the source's research question in a new way the source doesn't discuss
	e.g. from discussion post:
		your source says that group dances evolved to encourage people to talk more so they can figure out how to synchronize movements, and more talking leads to better cooperation
		(appropriate) original idea: "the source doesn't support their assumption that you need to talk to learn or perfect group dances; people usually learn these dances just by watching others do them"
			this is your own idea about the source argument
		(avoid) original idea: "actually, I think that group dances evolved because people like to dance but are embarrassed to do it alone"
			this is your own answer to the source's research question, not your idea about their argument

### Approaching the Disagreement
- You are NOT required to decide who is "right"
- Focus on understanding and explaining rather than judging
- Include your original ideas about the arguments presented, but avoid creating entirely new theories

### What Counts as Original Analysis
**Appropriate**: Your observations about the source's argument (e.g., "the source doesn't support their assumption that...")
**Avoid**: Your own alternative theories to answer the research question in ways the source doesn't discuss

### Getting Started
1. Read the target article once for general understanding
2. Read available commentaries to identify interesting disagreements
3. Re-read your chosen commentary and relevant sections
4. Map out exactly where and how they disagree before writing
