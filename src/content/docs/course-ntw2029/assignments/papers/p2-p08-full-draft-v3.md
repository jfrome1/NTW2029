## Purpose

This assignment helps you expand your P07 draft by discussing the significance of your analysis—what your work contributes to the academic conversation. Based on conference guidance, you'll identify specific ways to deepen your analysis. This draft will receive a conference where you'll get guidance on how to strengthen your final paper.

## Overview

Write a draft of up to 2750 words that includes everything from P07 (revised based on peer feedback) plus a required discussion of significance. You must also include at least 2 additional sources beyond the target article, commentary, and author's response (if relevant to your analysis). All papers must include analytical thesis, supporting analysis, and significance discussion—what distinguishes stronger work is the depth and sophistication of this analysis.

## Requirements

Your draft must include:

1. **Everything from P07** (revised based on peer review):
   - Brief explanation of both positions
   - Analytical thesis about what makes positions incompatible
   - Analysis supporting your thesis

2. **Significance discussion** (required for all students): Explain what your analysis contributes to the academic conversation. Address questions like:
   - What does your analysis reveal about this criticism?
   - What's at stake in how this disagreement is resolved?
   - How does understanding what makes positions incompatible advance understanding of the topic?
   - What would resolving this disagreement require?

3. **At least 2 additional sources** beyond target article, commentary, and author's response (if relevant to your analysis). Use these sources to:
   - Provide background on concepts or theories
   - Verify or evaluate specific empirical claims
   - Understand technical terms or disciplinary context

### About Your Significance Discussion

Your significance discussion must show what YOUR ANALYSIS reveals, not just summarize what's at stake according to the authors.

**Good examples of significance discussion:**
- "This analysis reveals that the disagreement isn't about empirical evidence but about incompatible definitions of 'exploration,' suggesting future research should clarify conceptual frameworks before testing predictions"
- "Understanding that these authors use different methodological approaches helps explain why their conclusions differ, and shows that both may be correct within their respective frameworks"

**Not acceptable:**
- "This matters because it's interesting" (too vague)
- "Students should care about this because..." (wrong audience—you're contributing to academic conversation, not teaching students)
- Just summarizing stakes the authors mention (needs YOUR insight about what your analysis reveals)

### Developing Depth

Stronger analysis often addresses one or more of these questions:

- What theoretical goals or disciplinary contexts make different approaches useful?
- What's gained and lost with each position?
- What would it take to resolve this disagreement?
- How do methodological commitments constrain possible conclusions?
- Why do these authors approach the problem differently?

The conference will help you identify specific opportunities to deepen YOUR analysis based on what your draft shows. Possible directions include:

- Examining other commentaries on the same issue
- Evaluating empirical studies cited by either author
- Using the author's response to clarify or complicate your analysis
- Proposing what would resolve the disagreement
- Explaining why different approaches might suit different research questions
- Identifying what assumptions would need to be true for each position

Not all papers will develop depth in the same way. What matters is strengthening YOUR paper's particular analysis.

### If You Include Evaluation

If your analysis leads you to support one position over another, you may include evaluative claims in P08, BUT your reasoning must be something YOU develop through analysis—not appeal to authority.

**Acceptable evaluation:**
"Smith's argument relies on assumption X, which is questionable because [student's own reasoning supported by additional sources or analysis]"

**Not acceptable:**
"Smith is wrong because Jones says so" (appeal to authority)

Your evaluation must emerge from YOUR analysis of assumptions, evidence, or methods, supported by additional sources or logical analysis you provide.

### Using Additional Sources Appropriately

**Appropriate uses:**
- Provide background on concepts or theories mentioned in articles
- Verify or evaluate specific empirical claims
- Understand technical terms or disciplinary context

**Inappropriate uses:**
- Introduce entirely new arguments not present in your chosen articles
- Substitute for close engagement with target and commentary
- Expand scope beyond your chosen criticism

Keep focus on analyzing the disagreement between target and commentary, using additional sources to support that analysis.

## Guidelines

### Building on P07

Revise your P07 draft based on peer feedback before expanding to P08. Your new content will develop the significance discussion and deepen analytical work identified through your own analysis and conference guidance.

### Your Analysis Should Drive Everything

Whether discussing significance or including evaluative claims, your reasoning must be something YOU contribute. Don't just cite one author against another—develop your own analytical insights supported by evidence and reasoning.

### Word Count as Maximum

The 2750-word maximum gives you space to develop your analysis fully and include everything you want feedback on. However, concise, focused analysis is often stronger than expansive, diffuse discussion. Use the space you need to make your argument effectively.

## Checklist

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist can remind you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it is not a comprehensive summary of all assignment requirements.

- [ ] Up to 2750 words
- [ ] Includes all revised P07 content (explanation, analytical thesis, analysis)
- [ ] Includes significance discussion showing what your analysis contributes
- [ ] Uses at least 2 additional sources beyond target, commentary, and author's response (if relevant)
- [ ] Additional sources used appropriately (support analysis, don't expand scope)
- [ ] Significance discussion shows YOUR insights, not just author stakes
- [ ] If includes evaluation, reasoning is YOUR analysis (not appeal to authority)
- [ ] Maintains focus on analyzing chosen criticism
- [ ] All claims supported with evidence and citations

## Feedback

You'll receive a conference after submitting P08. The conference will assess what your draft shows you're capable of and provide specific guidance on how to strengthen your analysis for P09. This is similar to the P1 conference—the focus will be on what YOUR paper needs next, not general tiers of work.
