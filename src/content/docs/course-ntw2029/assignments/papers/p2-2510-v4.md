## Purpose

This paper develops your ability to identify and analyze scholarly disagreements in academic conversations. You'll learn how different interpretations of evidence lead to different conclusions and practice evaluating what's at stake in theoretical debates within evolutionary psychology.

## Overview

Write a 2000-2500 word paper that explains and analyzes one specific disagreement between a target article and one of its commentaries. You'll work with one of several provided articles from *Behavioral and Brain Sciences* (BBS), focusing on a limited aspect of the debate rather than the entire article.

## Requirements

### Source Requirements

Choose one target article and one commentary article from the provided options:

**Target Article Options:**

Use at least four sources total: the target article, the commentary, the author's response (if applicable), plus at least one additional academic source.

### Content Requirements

All papers must provide:

- **Accurate summary** of the target article's overall argument
- **Accurate explanation** of what the commentary challenges in the target's argument (whether explicitly stated or implicitly assumed)
- **Analysis** of what makes them incompatible—different definitions, assumptions, standards for evidence, or interpretations
- **Discussion** of why this disagreement matters for understanding the topic
- **Thesis** stating what you've discovered about the argument's limitations or the disagreement's implications

*For detailed guidance on developing analytical theses and understanding what distinguishes basic from sophisticated analysis, see the P07 and P09 assignment pages.*

### Length and Format

- 2000-2500 words
- Follow all standard paper formatting requirements
- Include proper in-text citations and References section
- Highlight thesis in yellow (2 sentences max)
- Highlight topic sentences in body paragraphs in light blue

## Paper 2 Process

Paper 2 develops through a scaffolded sequence:

- **P04: Article Selection** (Week 9) - Choose articles and explain initial interest (200 words)
- **P05: Disagreement Summary** (Week 10) - Map disagreement via structured worksheet (500 words)
- **P06: Explain Positions** (Week 10) - Explain both positions without analysis (700-1000 words, conference)
- **P07: Working Draft** (Week 11) - Add analytical thesis and supporting analysis (1200-1500 words, peer review)
- **P08: Full Draft** (Week 12) - Add significance discussion and sources (up to 2500 words, conference)
- **P09: Final Paper** (Week 13) - Final polished paper (2000-2500 words, graded)

See individual assignment pages for detailed instructions. P07 provides guidance on developing analytical theses and making analytical moves. P09 contains the assessment framework and examples of what distinguishes stronger analysis.

## Assessment

Papers are assessed on Understanding (30%), Analysis (40%), Significance (20%), and Clarity (10%). All papers must include all core components—what distinguishes grades is the depth and sophistication with which you answer core questions about the disagreement.

See P09 for detailed assessment framework, grade differentiation examples, and questions that guide deeper analytical work.

## Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. Read the target article for general understanding
2. Read available commentaries to identify interesting disagreements
3. Re-read your chosen passages, focusing on the disputed aspect
4. Map exactly where and how they disagree before writing

Focus on one specific aspect the commentary challenges—not the entire target article.

### Developing Your Analysis

This paper requires different thesis development than Paper 1:

Your thesis should **emerge from your analysis** of the disagreement, not precede it. You cannot know what you'll conclude until you've carefully analyzed both positions and what makes them incompatible.

For example:

**Productive analysis:** "The target's definition excludes cases the commentary presents, revealing a gap in what the theory can explain."

**Premature side-picking:** "I agree with the commentary because their position makes more sense."

The first reveals argument structure through analysis. The second chooses sides without demonstrating why.

### Structure

All papers should include:

- **Introduction** - Orient reader to the disagreement and state thesis
- **Target summary** - Explain overall argument with focus on disputed aspect  
- **Commentary explanation** - What they challenge and why
- **Analysis** - What makes positions incompatible and why it matters
- **Conclusion** - Synthesize implications

These may be one or more paragraphs each, depending on your paper's needs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About the Assignment

**Why BBS format with pre-selected articles?**
BBS articles include published commentaries that directly engage with the target's arguments. This gives you genuine scholarly disagreements to analyze rather than requiring you to find compatible sources yourself.

**Can I change my article selection after P04?**
Only if you discover during P05 or P06 that your chosen pairing doesn't have enough substantive disagreement. Consult with instructor before switching.

**What if I can't find enough disagreement in my chosen pairing?**
This suggests you need to understand the positions more deeply. During P06 conference, we'll identify where the real incompatibility lies.

**How is Paper 2 different from Paper 1?**
P1 developed your own argument about a topic. P2 analyzes someone else's disagreement to understand what makes scholarly positions incompatible.

### About Sources

**Do all commentaries count as sources or just my chosen one?**
Only your chosen commentary counts as one of your required sources. If you examine additional commentaries for depth, those count as additional sources.

**What counts as an "additional source" beyond target/commentary/response?**
Any academic source that helps you understand concepts, evaluate claims, or provide disciplinary context. Can include research cited in the commentary, theoretical background, or empirical studies.

**Can I use sources the commentary cites?**
Yes—especially if you're evaluating whether cited research actually supports the commentary's claims.

**How many sources is too many?**
No maximum, but keep focus on analyzing your chosen disagreement. Sources should support that analysis, not expand into new territory.

### About Analysis

**What's the difference between explanation and analysis?**
Explanation describes what each position argues. Analysis identifies what makes positions incompatible—the assumptions, definitions, or commitments that drive different conclusions.

**What does "analytical thesis" mean?**
A claim about what makes the positions incompatible, not an evaluation of which is stronger. See P07 assignment for examples and detailed guidance on developing analytical theses.

**Am I supposed to pick a side?**
Not required. You may include evaluation if your analysis supports it, but the core task is understanding what makes positions incompatible.

**What if I agree with both the target and commentary?**
Then your analysis should explain what allows both to be correct—different frameworks, different questions, different evidence standards.

### About Process

**Why so many scaffolding assignments?**
Each assignment builds specific skills: P04 focuses selection, P05 maps disagreement structure, P06 develops explanation, P07 adds analysis, P08 adds significance and sources.

**What happens if I do poorly on P06—can I still succeed on P09?**
Yes. P06 conference identifies what needs strengthening. P07-P08 give you opportunities to develop those areas.

**Can I get feedback between P07 and P08?**
You get peer review after P07 and can request additional guidance via email or office hours.

**How much should I revise between drafts?**
Revise based on feedback received. P07→P08 typically adds new content (significance, sources). P08→P09 refines and strengthens based on conference.

### About Requirements

**Does word count include references?**
No. Word count is body text only (excludes references, title, headers).

**What if my paper is under/over word count?**
Under suggests incomplete development. Over suggests lack of focus or needed editing. Aim for range specified in assignment.

**Do I need formal introduction/conclusion sections?**
You need introductory content that orients readers and concluding content that synthesizes implications, but these don't require labeled sections.

**How many quotes should I use?**
Use quotes for specific claims you're analyzing. Don't overquote—most content should be paraphrase and analysis.

### About Grading

**Where can I find the grading rubric?**
See P09 for the assessment framework, which describes Understanding (30%), Analysis (40%), Significance (20%), and Clarity (10%) with examples of what distinguishes B-range, A-range, and C-range work.

**Is depth work required for an A?**
No. You can achieve A-range through particularly sophisticated answers to core questions OR through addressing depth questions effectively. See P09 for details.

**What's the difference between basic requirements and deeper analysis?**
All papers must include all components (explanation, analytical thesis, analysis, significance). Deeper analysis means more sophisticated insights, not additional sections. P07 and P09 provide frameworks for understanding depth.

## Feedback

You will receive conference feedback on P06 (explanation) and P08 (full draft). P09 receives a grade and written feedback. Use conferences to identify specific strengths and areas for development in your analysis.
