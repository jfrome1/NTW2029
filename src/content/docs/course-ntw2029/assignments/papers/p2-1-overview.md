## Overview

Write a paper that clearly [:explains and analyzes](#x-explains-and-analyzes) a [:recent,  published academic argument](#x-recent-published-academic-argument) about EP and art to [:your target audience](#x-your-target-audience).

This paper likely has different goals than other final papers you have written in the past, so check and follow [:these guidelines](#x-these-guidelines)

The assignment is broken into many parts to guide you through the process. You may feel uncertain, but you can do this!

## Assignment purpose

Paper 2 will allow you to build and demonstrate the writing skills taught in this course.

## Logistics

- Paper length: 2250-2750 words, excluding reference list
- Your specific paper topic and main source must be approved and finalized before the Paper 2 source summary due week 9
	- Your main source can be an article or a book chapter; don't choose a whole book as your main source
	- My source approval means that I don't see any obvious problems with using your source, but I won't be able to read all of your sources closely at this point, so I cannot take responsibility for making sure the source will work well for Paper 2. That is your responsibility.
- Your paper must use at least four academic sources, including one main source (the focus of your analysis) and three or more supporting sources
	- With approval (and only with approval), you also have the option of comparing two primary sources and using two or more supporting sources
- You may not choose [any sources chosen by current or previous students](/course-ntw2029/assignments/papers/p2-02-sources) as your main source (but they can be supplementary sources)
- These will include one main source (the focus of your analysis) and three or more supporting sources
- With approval (and only with approval), you also have the option of comparing two primary sources and using two or more supporting sources
- You must submit all parts of the assignment to get credit for the paper
- Late submission of any part may lead to a grade penalty.

<!-- ## Paper 2 process

Selecting and understanding your source

- Paper 2 general topic proposal (due Sat 28 Feb 2025): suggest some topics of interest related to EP and art
- Paper 2 brief source summary and context (due Sat 15 Mar 2025): briefly summarize your source's contribution to an academic conversation
- Paper 2 source summary and (optional) source summary outline (due Sat 22 Mar 2025): summarize the source argument, optionally in outline form
- Paper 2 proposal and revised source summary outline (due Sat 29 Mar 2025): I'll provide questions to help you figure out how to approach your source analysis; you submit answers to those questions as your Paper 2 proposal and attach a revised source summary outline

Drafting

- Paper 2 introduction and full outline (due Sat 5 Apr 2025): write a draft introduction to Paper 2, including a proposed thesis, and a draft outline of all of Paper 2
- Paper 2 full draft (due Sat 12 Apr 2025): write a full draft that does these things:
	- contextualize the source argument within a larger academic conversation
	- explain the source argument
	- analyze the source argument
	- explain the implications of your analysis
	- (optional) improve or correct the argument

Revision

- Paper 2 final paper (due one week after your conference):
	- refine the paper thesis, structure, examples, and analysis
	- refine the transitions and sentence-level writing
	- proofread, polish, check citations and formatting

Detailed guidance for each of these steps will be provided in class and in future assignments

##### :x explains and analyzes

- explain the sources attempted contribution to an ongoing academic conversation
- analyze some specific aspect of that argument in a way that adds to the academic conversation by telling your reader what you think/how they should think about your source (and, optionally and if appropriate, a way the argument could be improved)

##### :x recent published academic argument

- "recent" means within the last ten years (exceptions can be made upon request if there is not a more recent source on the particular issue the source discusses, just check before asking for an exception)
- academic sources do not include personal webpages, Wikipedia, or most blogs (exceptions exist)
- academic sources include books and journals published by a university press or an academic press
- university presses include the university name (e.g. University of Chicago Press or Oxford University Press)
- academic presses that are not university presses include [:these presses](#x-these-presses)

##### :x these presses

- Elsevier
- Springer
- Wiley-Blackwell
- Taylor & Francis
- Sage Publications
- Palgrave Macmillan
- Brill
- Routledge
- De Gruyter
- Nature Publishing Group
- PLOS (Public Library of Science)
- The Royal Society

##### :x your target audience

In this course, your target audience is an NUSC student without expertise in your topic.

##### :x these guidelines

Most important:

- Your goal is NOT to answer a research question by synthesizing what other people have said about it. This course demands a more ambitious goal, which includes adding something to the academic conversation.
- Your goal is NOT to try to answer a research question by proposing and defending your own theory about EP and art. That is overly ambitious and not realistic given the time limits and introductory nature of this course.

Other guidelines:

- Your thesis should NOT combine two or more sources to show how they complement or relate to each other. That approach may reflect interesting insights, but it would not lead to a close analysis of a source argument. (In some cases, an analytic comparison of two sources that disagree on one specific point is appropriate, but only with my advance approval.)
- Your topic or question should not ask whether X is primarily genetic or primarily cultural. It's very hard to answer that kind of question because it's very hard to measure or compare [:the relative importance of different factors](#x-the-relative-importance-of-different-factors) that cause the same thing.
- Remember that, according to EP, any trait related to a type of art that came into being within the last 500 years cannot be an adaptation because EP holds that traits can't evolve that quickly.

##### :x the relative importance of different factors

Yes, there are many statistical methods that have been developed to do multifactor analysis, but thats not a type of research approach that we can easily analyze in this course. Further, I cant guide you in evaluating that type of statistical work, so its probably best to avoid sources that rely on those approaches.
