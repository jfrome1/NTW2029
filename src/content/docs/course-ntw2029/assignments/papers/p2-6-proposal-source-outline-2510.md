## Assignment

### Purpose

This assignment has two important purposes. First, it helps you develop a clear thesis statement and analytical direction for Paper 2 by requiring you to articulate exactly what you plan to analyze about your source and why it matters. Second, it ensures you thoroughly understand your source's argument by revising your source summary outline based on peer feedback.

### Overview

You will submit a comprehensive proposal that answers specific questions about your planned Paper 2 analysis, along with a revised source summary outline that accurately maps your source's argument structure.

## Instructions

1. Prepare your proposal by answering the following questions in full sentences using a clear, formal style:

   a. What is the academic conversation to which the source aims to contribute? Make sure to identify the phenomenon the conversation aims to explain and consider what your source says "they say". Be specific rather than general.
      - Example (too general): "The source aims to contribute to the academic discussion about how music evolved in humans."
      - Example (appropriately specific): "The source aims to contribute to the academic discussion about which of three specific theories best explains how music evolved in humans: social cohesion, parent-infant signaling, and mate attraction."

   b. What are the source's main theses or conclusions that contribute to this academic conversation? (1-3 main claims only)
      - Example: "Mehr et al. make three main claims: (1) music evolved primarily as a credible signal to communicate information about social bonds, (2) musical features like rhythm and pitch are adaptations specifically designed to enhance signal credibility, and (3) alternative theories like sexual selection cannot fully explain music's origins."

   c. Which one of these claims (or contributing sub-claim) do you plan to analyze? Pick a claim that seems (most likely to be) incomplete, ambiguous, problematic, or limited in some way.
      - Example: "I plan to analyze the source's second claim that musical features evolved specifically as adaptations for signal credibility. This claim is potentially problematic because it relies on assumptions about ancient acoustic environments that cannot be directly verified, and the evidence presented doesn't adequately rule out the possibility that these features evolved for other purposes."

   d. Write a 250 word (max) summary of the argument the source uses to support the claim. Make sure the summary clearly connects the claim to the academic conversation. The summary is a narrative presentation of the argument.

   e. In a list or outline form, state brief summaries of the reasons and evidence (if any) supporting the claim, as well as any important assumptions the claim relies on. The list is a way to think of the claim as the logical conclusion of premises in an argument.
      - Note: parts d and e are intentionally redundant; I'm asking you to convey the argument in two different ways because it can be helpful to think about things from different angles.

   f. If you can, suggest one or two possible ways you are thinking about evaluating, correcting, or improving the argument.
      - Example 1 (identifying a methodological limitation): "I plan to evaluate the source's argument by examining whether the cross-cultural samples used are sufficiently diverse. The study primarily draws examples from Western and East Asian musical traditions while claiming universality, which may limit the strength of their conclusions."
      - Example 2 (identifying a conceptual gap): "I plan to evaluate the source's claim that art preferences are sexually dimorphic by examining whether their theoretical framework adequately accounts for cultural variation in art preferences that doesn't align with predicted evolutionary patterns."
      - Example 3 (suggesting an improvement): "I plan to suggest that the source's explanation of narrative engagement could be strengthened by incorporating more recent findings on neural synchronization during storytelling, which would provide a stronger mechanism for their proposed evolutionary function."

   g. If you can, suggest why your challenge might be significant to the academic conversation about this topic. Even if you can't do it right now, in your final paper, you will have to explain why your discussion is significant to the academic conversation.

2. Revise your source summary outline based on peer feedback, ensuring it meets all outline requirements. The outline should accurately represent the logical structure of your source's argument.

3. Format your submission as follows:
   - Use your main source citation information as your proposal title (properly formatted as if in a reference list)
   - Copy/paste the questions from instruction #1 into your proposal and put your answers below each question
   - Place your revised source summary outline after your proposal answers

## Guidelines

### Understanding "They Say"

To effectively analyze your source, you must understand what "they say":

- The academic conversation the source aims to contribute to
- What others have contributed to this conversation
- The source thesis and supporting argument(s)
- How the source argument contributes (or tries to contribute) to the academic conversation

### Developing What "I Say"

This proposal is your first step in developing your own analytical response:

- For theoretical sources, focus on a narrow part of the overall argument
- For empirical sources, identify criticisms that contribute to a unifying, evaluative claim about the source

### Avoiding Common Analytical Pitfalls

Be cautious about these common analytical approaches, which often lead to weak papers:

- "I argue that X is not the only factor causing Y" (do they claim it's the only factor? usually they don't)
- "They explain A, but not B, and I fill the gap by explaining B" (is B needed to support A or is it a separate topic/question? does the source intend to discuss B? if not, you're not participating in the same academic conversation)
- "The theory doesn't fully/completely explain all examples of the phenomenon" (is their goal to do this? is it possible to do this? do the exceptions undermine their argument or show that it is never true, or just that it's not perfect?)

## Checklist

- Proposal included with answers to all required questions
- Main source citation properly formatted as the proposal title
- Revised source summary outline follows outline guidelines
- GenAI link or non-use statement included
- Updated workload report submitted under Exercise 10

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist reminds you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it is not a comprehensive summary of all requirements. You must read the complete assignment description to fully understand what's expected.

## Feedback

I will review your proposal and outline before our individual conference next week. My feedback will focus on whether your proposed analysis is sufficiently focused and significant to the academic conversation, and whether your source summary outline accurately represents the source's argument structure. This feedback will help you refine your analytical direction for Paper 2.

Claude examples:

I'll provide examples of good and below-average answers for each question, based on the Hagen and Bryant article about music and dance as a coalition signaling system. After each below-average example, I'll explain why it's problematic.

## Question 1: What is the academic conversation to which the source aims to contribute?

### Good Answer:

The source aims to contribute to the academic conversation about the evolutionary function of music and dance in humans. Specifically, it addresses the puzzle of why humans have neural specializations for processing music when the predominant theories (sexual selection and social bonding) cannot fully explain important features of human music like synchronized group performances. The authors note that existing theories cannot account for why humans, unlike other primates, engage in synchronized group performances, why we have rhythmic abilities not found in other primates, and why we support musically talented individuals.

### Below-Average Answer:

The source aims to contribute to the academic conversation about why people like music and dance. The authors want to explain why music evolved in humans.

#### Why it's not good:

This answer is too vague and lacks specificity about the academic context. It doesn't identify the scholarly debate the authors are entering, doesn't mention the competing theories they're addressing, and fails to demonstrate understanding of the evolutionary psychology framework the paper operates within. It also doesn't identify what phenomenon the conversation aims to explain (neural specializations for music and dance).

## Question 2: What are the sources' main theses or conclusions?

### Good Answer:

The authors propose three main claims: (1) Music and dance evolved primarily as a coalition signaling system that allows groups to credibly communicate their quality and internal stability to other groups; (2) This signaling system helped solve the unique human challenge of forming cooperative alliances between groups of unrelated individuals; and (3) The synchronization and complexity of musical performances serve as honest signals of both a group's internal cohesion (time spent together) and their ability to coordinate complex actions, qualities valuable in potential allies.

### Below-Average Answer:

The authors conclude that music evolved to help groups work together and that singing and dancing together shows other groups that you are good allies. Also, music makes people feel emotions.

#### Why it's not good:

While this captures some basic elements, it lacks precision and misses crucial aspects of the argument. It doesn't clearly articulate the coalition signaling hypothesis in evolutionary terms, doesn't explain the relationship between synchronization and signaling coalition quality, and doesn't connect these claims to the broader evolutionary puzzle the authors are addressing. The mention of emotions is peripheral to the main thesis.

## Question 3: Which claim do you plan to analyze?

### Good Answer:

I plan to analyze the authors' claim that "synchronization and variation in music and dance are ideally suited to credibly signal both that a coalition has been internally stable... and that they are able to execute rapid, complex, coordinated action." This claim is central to their coalition signaling hypothesis but relies on several assumptions about the relationship between practice time, synchronization ability, and coalition stability that may be problematic when examining cross-cultural evidence.

### Below-Average Answer:

I want to analyze their claim that music evolved to signal coalition quality because I think music is more about emotions than the authors say.

#### Why it's not good:

This answer doesn't specify which aspect of the coalition signaling hypothesis will be analyzed and doesn't identify what might be problematic about it. The critique seems based on a personal preference rather than identifying a specific weakness, ambiguity, or limitation in the argument. It also doesn't show an understanding of how the claim fits into the larger theoretical framework.

## Question 4: 250-word summary of the argument

### Good Answer:

Hagen and Bryant argue that music and dance evolved as credible signals of coalition quality that facilitated the uniquely human ability to form cooperative relationships between groups of unrelated individuals. Unlike other primates, humans form alliances between groups that are not based on kinship. For these alliances to evolve, groups needed ways to reliably signal two key components of coalition quality: internal stability (long-term cooperative motivation) and the ability to perform coordinated actions.

The authors propose that music and dance performances serve as honest signals of these qualities because they require substantial time to compose and practice. Recently formed coalitions could only perform simple, unsynchronized music, while long-established coalitions could perform complex, highly synchronized performances. Since the time required to master complex performances necessarily correlates with the time members have associated with each other, these displays provide reliable information about internal stability.

Their hypothesis explains several features of music that other theories cannot: synchronized group performances, the uniqueness of rhythm among primates, cross-cultural association of music with alliance formation, and leadership support for talented musicians. Their experiment showed that manipulating synchrony affected perceptions of both music quality and coalition quality, supporting their model.

This theory doesn't replace sexual selection or social bonding hypotheses but incorporates them within a broader framework. While sexual selection explains solo performances and social cohesion explains within-group benefits, coalition signaling explains the widespread cross-cultural pattern of elaborate, synchronized performances during alliance formation and intergroup competition.

### Below-Average Answer:

Hagen and Bryant think music evolved to help groups signal that they are good quality coalitions. They say that people who practice music a lot together must have been together for a long time, so they are probably a stable group. Also, if they can play music in sync, that shows they can coordinate well for other things too. They did an experiment where they played music that was in sync and out of sync, and people thought the in-sync music was better and that the musicians were a better coalition.

They talk about how animals like birds and apes do coordinated calls to defend territory, and they think human music might have started like that. They also say their idea is better than other theories like sexual selection because it explains things like why people perform music in groups and why we have rhythm. They think their idea explains more about music than other theories.

#### Why it's not good:

While this summary includes some basic points, it lacks cohesion and fails to articulate how the argument addresses the academic conversation. It doesn't explain the evolutionary problem (intergroup cooperation) that music supposedly helped solve, doesn't clearly connect synchronization to coalition quality in an evolutionary framework, and doesn't explain the causal relationship between these elements. It also lacks precision in describing the theoretical framework and empirical support.

## Question 5: List/outline of reasons and evidence

### Good Answer:

**Main claim**: Music and dance evolved as a coalition signaling system that credibly communicates coalition quality to potential allies and enemies.

**Supporting reasons and evidence**:

1. Humans uniquely form cooperative alliances between unrelated groups
   - Unlike other primates (except hamadryas baboons)
   - Intergroup cooperation required credible signaling of coalition quality

2. Two key components of coalition quality needed to be signaled:
   - Internal stability (long-term cooperative motivation)
   - Ability to perform coordinated actions

3. Music/dance performances credibly signal these qualities because:
   - Mastering complex compositions requires substantial practice time
   - Time spent practicing necessarily correlates with time spent as a coalition
   - Synchronization ability demonstrates coordination capabilities

4. Empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis:
   - Experimental finding that synchrony affects perceptions of both music quality and coalition quality
   - Cross-cultural ethnographic evidence showing music's importance in alliance formation
   - Evidence of extensive rehearsals in traditional societies

5. The hypothesis explains features other theories cannot:
   - Group synchronized performances
   - Uniqueness of rhythm in humans
   - Support for talented musicians by group leaders

**Key assumptions**:

- Coalition quality was crucial for alliance formation and warfare success in ancestral environments
- Mastering music requires substantial group practice that cannot be easily faked
- Musical synchrony ability correlates with other coordination abilities

### Below-Average Answer:

**Reasons the authors think music evolved as coalition signaling:**

- Other theories don't explain group music
- Animals use vocalizations to defend territory
- Music takes practice
- Their experiment showed people think synchronized music is better
- People who know each other longer play better music together
- Groups need to show they are good quality

**Evidence:**

- Their study
- Some quotes from ethnographers
- Examples of animals making calls together

#### Why it's not good:

This outline fails to structure the argument logically, doesn't distinguish between premises and conclusions, and doesn't show how the reasons build on each other. It lists elements of the argument without showing their relationships or explaining how they support the main claim. It also fails to identify key assumptions and doesn't prioritize the most important elements of the argument.

## Question 6: Ways to evaluate, correct, or improve the argument

### Good Answer:

One way I plan to evaluate this argument is by examining cross-cultural evidence about music learning and performance. While the authors assume that mastering music requires substantial group practice that necessarily signals coalition stability, ethnomusicological research shows tremendous variation in how quickly different musical traditions can be learned. Some musical traditions emphasize improvisation rather than rehearsed synchronization, which might serve coalition signaling functions through different mechanisms than the authors propose.

Another approach would be analyzing whether the correlation between synchronization ability and coalition quality necessarily implies causation in the evolutionary direction the authors suggest. An alternative hypothesis is that music evolved first for individual or dyadic purposes (like mother-infant bonding), and was later co-opted for coalition signaling when intergroup cooperation became advantageous. This modified chronology might better accommodate evidence from developmental psychology and neuroimaging studies.

### Below-Average Answer:

I think the authors' argument could be improved by considering that people might just enjoy music and dance for fun, not because of signaling. Also, they should look at more musical traditions from different cultures before making these claims.

#### Why it's not good:

This response doesn't engage deeply with the theoretical framework of the paper. Suggesting that music evolved "for fun" doesn't address the evolutionary explanation the authors are seeking. The critique lacks specificity about what cultural variations might challenge the theory and doesn't identify any specific theoretical or empirical weaknesses. A good response would offer concrete alternative explanations or identify specific gaps in the evidence or reasoning.

## Question 7: Significance to the academic conversation

### Good Answer:

My analysis of the relationship between musical synchronization and coalition signaling will contribute significantly to the evolutionary psychology of music by refining our understanding of the proximate mechanisms involved. If, as I suspect, the ability to quickly master synchronized performances varies substantially across cultures and musical traditions, we need a more nuanced model of how music signals coalition quality that accommodates this variation.

This refinement matters because it addresses a key question in cultural evolution: whether specialized cognitive adaptations for music preceded complex cultural practices or whether general learning mechanisms were sufficient. By examining the specific relationship between learning time, synchronization, and coalition quality signaling, my analysis will help clarify whether music represents a specialized evolutionary adaptation for intergroup cooperation or a cultural innovation built on more general cognitive capabilities.

### Below-Average Answer:

My critique is important because understanding why music evolved helps us appreciate music better. If we know music evolved to help groups work together, maybe we can use music more effectively in modern life to improve teamwork.

#### Why it's not good:

This answer doesn't connect the analysis to the academic conversation about music evolution. It shifts to practical applications rather than theoretical significance and doesn't explain how the proposed analysis would advance scholarly understanding of evolutionary psychology or music origins. A good response would explain how the analysis addresses specific theoretical questions or debates within the field.
