## Assignment

### Purpose

This assignment helps you finalize a source for Paper 2 and develop a clear understanding of how your source fits into its academic conversation. Understanding this context is essential for crafting a successful analytical paper. When you identify the conversation your source participates in and its specific contribution, you'll be better positioned to analyze the source's claims in your final paper.

### Overview

You'll identify your main source for Paper 2 and write two paragraphs: one describing the academic conversation your source contributes to, and another describing your source's research approach and contribution to that conversation. This assignment builds on your earlier source proposal and prepares you for the more detailed source summary outline that follows.

## Instructions

### Pre-assignment approval

To increase your chances of finding a good source, for this one assignment, you are allowed to email me your proposed source in advance to ask for approval, with these guidelines:

- you can only email one source at a time
- you must put NTW2029 in the subject line of your email
- you must include full source citation information including a DOI link or equivalent
- you must complete this assignment (Paper 2 brief source summary) whether or not I approve a source for you over email

In planning your work, assume that it will take me 1 business day (excluding weekends) to reply.

Although ideally the source you propose will be approved, if needed, you can still change the source (with approval). You must have an approved source before the next assignment, Paper 2 source summary and (optional) source summary outline (due 22 Mar 2025)

### Submit source summary

Format a proper APA citation for your source as the title of your submission, including a link to the source on the webpage of the journal or press where it was originally published. If the source doesn't have a URL, please link to the source search result link at NUS libraries.

Write two paragraphs (max 600 words total):

- The first paragraph should describe the academic conversation your source intends to contribute to, including what your source says others have previously contributed to that conversation.
- The second paragraph should describe your source's research approach and contribution to that conversation.

## Guidelines

- Your source aims to add to an academic conversation. Consider these questions while describing that conversation:
	- What is the phenomenon that the conversation aims to understand or explain?
	- What is the knowledge gap or puzzling aspect of that phenomenon?
	- What have others said about this phenomenon?
	- Why isn't your source satisfied with current knowledge or other explanations of the phenomena?
	- You don't need to answer each question separately; they're just to help you think about the academic conversation.
- There's no need to do extensive outside research about the academic conversation at this stage; rely primarily on your source and make inferences if necessary.
- Pay attention to the source's abstract, introduction, and conclusion, as these sections typically clarify how the source positions itself within an academic conversation.
- If you want to learn more about the academic conversation (for this or future assignments), try these approaches:
	- Look at your source's introduction, where authors typically address what "they say" (other scholars' contributions and gaps in the literature), and look at those sources
	- Check the literature review page on the course website for relevant literature reviews in your topic area
	- Use Google Scholar's "cited by" and "related articles" features to see how your source connects to other research
- Avoid choosing a literature review as your main source, as these typically synthesize existing research rather than making original arguments that you can analyze.

## Checklist

- APA citation as title
- First paragraph: describes the academic conversation
- Second paragraph: explains your source's contribution
- Word count: 600 max
- Include GenAI link/non-use statement and word count
