## Assignment Purpose

The goal is to describe how your Paper 2 source fits into its academic conversation.

## Assignment Requirements

For this assignment:

1. Propose an [:appropriate source](#x-verify-source-is-appropriate) to analyze for Paper 2.
2. Title your submission with the source citation in proper APA format, including a proper link that lets me easily locate the source.
3. Write two paragraphs (max 600 words total):
   - First paragraph: Describe the :[academic conversation your source contributes to](#x-identify-academic-conversation)
   - Second paragraph: Explain your source's research approach and the [:specific contribution](#x-describe-contribution) they claim to make
4. Cite page numbers for any paraphrased content from your source in this simple format: (4)
5. Follow paper assignment guidelines, including work count and a GenAI chat link or non-use statement.

Although ideally the source you propose will be approved, if needed, you can still change the source (with approval). You must have an approved source before the next assignment, Paper 2 source summary and (optional) source summary outline (due 22 Mar 2025)

### Pre-assignment approval

To increase your chances of finding a good source, for this one assignment, you are allowed to email me your proposed source in advance to ask for approval, with these guidelines:

- you can only email one source at a time
- you must put NTW2029 in the subject line of your email
- you must include full source citation information including a DOI link or equivalent
- you must complete this assignment whether or not I approve a source for you over email

In planning your work, assume that it will take me 1 business day (excluding weekends) to reply.

##### :x verify source is appropriate

Your source must:

- Be recent (published within the last 10 years)
- Be published in an academic journal or by an academic press
- Make an argumentative claim (not just a [literature review](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/in-class/literature-reviews))
- Answer Contribute to a conversation about evolutionary psychology and art

To verify your source is appropriate:

- Check the introduction to confirm it makes a specific argument
- Look for literature review sections to identify the academic conversation
- Make sure the source proposes and defends a thesis rather than just summarizing existing research

Literature reviews typically:

- Have words like "review," "survey," or "overview" in the title
- Discuss many different theories without strongly advocating for one
- Come from handbooks or companions (e.g., "The Oxford Handbook of...")
- Aim to provide a broad overview rather than advance a specific argument

##### :x identify academic conversation

Your source aims to add to an academic conversation. Using your source, describe that conversation.

Here are some questions to consider while writing your description (you don't need to answer each of these questions separately):

- What is the phenomenon that the conversation aims to understand or explain?
- What is the knowledge gap or puzzling aspect of that phenomenon?
- What have others said about this phenomenon?
- Why is your source not satisfied with current knowledge or other explanations of the phenomena?

You don't need to do outside research to answer these questions; rely on your source, and make inferences if necessary (but be clear when you are doing so).

Looking at your source's introduction and literature review sections can help you identify how it positions itself within an academic conversation.

##### :x describe contribution

After describing the academic conversation in your first paragraph, explain your source's attempted contribution to that conversation in a separate paragraph.

Focus on:

- What argumentative thesis does the source propose and defend?
- How does the source think their thesis adds to the academic conversation?

You should be able to get this information from just the source abstract (if any), introduction, and conclusion.
