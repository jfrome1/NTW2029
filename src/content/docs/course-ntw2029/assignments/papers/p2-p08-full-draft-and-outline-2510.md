## Purpose

This assignment helps you build on your P2 work to produce a full draft and simplified outline.

## Overview

Write a draft of up to 2750 words structured as a complete essay, including an introduction, thesis, explanation, analysis, and a conclusion discussing significance. Integrate insights written for P07 and revised through peer review into the full draft.

## Requirements

Write a document with three parts: full draft, reference list, and simplified outline.

1. **Full draft**

Your draft should include:

- **Introduction**: [:How to write your introduction](#x-how-to-write-your-introduction) [:Developing your thesis](#x-developing-your-thesis)

- **Body (Explanation and Analysis)**: Explain the target article's argument, the commentary's criticism, and (if applicable) the target's response. Analyze the disagreement to support your thesis. Typically it's best to provide explanation first, then analysis. However, in some cases mixing explanation and analysis as you move from topic to topic works better. What's best depends on your specific essay.

- **Conclusion (Significance)**: Your significance discussion should reveal why understanding this disagreement matters. [:Developing your significance discussion](#x-developing-your-significance-discussion)

- **Use of at least 4 academic sources**: The target article, commentary, and author's response can each count as one source. "Use of" means that all sources must be cited in the essay text. [:Using additional sources appropriately](#x-using-additional-sources-appropriately)

Read guidelines on [:using writing from P07](#x-using-writing-from-p07)

2. **Reference list**

Check guidelines on the [Citations](https://ntw-2029.vercel.app/course-ntw2029/resources/citations/#part-2-reference-list)  page.

3. **Simplified outline**: Create an outline of your draft's topic sentences. [:How to create and use your outline](#x-how-to-create-and-use-your-outline)

4. **Reflection**: After your outline, briefly describe: (a) questions you have about your draft, and (b) aspects you're having trouble with or feel uncertain about.

## Guidelines

### Developing Depth

Stronger analysis often addresses one or more of these questions:

- What theoretical goals or disciplinary contexts make different approaches useful?
- What's gained and lost with each position?
- What would it take to resolve this disagreement?
- How do methodological commitments constrain possible conclusions?
- Why do these authors approach the problem differently?
- What patterns or structures drive the disagreement that neither author explicitly names?
- What makes this disagreement harder to resolve than it appears on the surface?

The conference will help you identify specific opportunities to strengthen your paper's analysis based on what your draft shows. Possible directions include:

- Examining other commentaries on the same issue
- Evaluating empirical studies cited by either author
- Using the author's response to clarify or complicate your analysis
- Proposing what would resolve the disagreement
- Explaining why different approaches might suit different research questions
- Identifying what assumptions would need to be true for each position

Not all papers will develop depth in the same way. What matters is strengthening each paper's particular analysis.

Depth often comes from getting below the surface to understand what implicit issues the disagreement reflects. This doesn't mean being clever for its own sake. It means:

- Identifying assumptions or commitments that aren't explicitly stated but drive the disagreement
- Examining details in cited research to understand why the authors disagree about what evidence shows
- Recognizing structural features of their approaches that explain why the disagreement persists
- Revealing patterns that neither author explicitly names

## Feedback

You'll receive recorded feedback on P08 to discuss in a conference during Week 13.

##### :x using writing from P07

P07 developed your analytical understanding through verification and thesis development. P08 transforms that understanding into a complete essay with proper framing and significance discussion. Here's how P07 work carries forward into P08:

- Thesis
    - Your working thesis from P07 should evolve as you continue your analysis.
    - Some theses will become more refined and detailed; others might significantly shift focus from explicit disagreement to underlying causes. Different paths are appropriate depending on what your analysis reveals.
- Explanation of both positions
    - A very brief version of your explanation will go in your introduction above your thesis--just enough to set context and make your thesis understandable. The essay body will contain a more detailed version.
- Verification of disagreement
    - Your thesis should state what verification revealed (genuine disagreement, mischaracterization, terminological confusion, etc.)
    - If the verification was straightforward (i.e. target and commentary's claims were both clear and accurate), your explanation will include the verified claims.
    - If the verification was complicated or nuanced, your explanation will likely present a simple version of the claims, and your analysis will use verification evidence (specific quotes, characterization checks) to support claims about the disagreement.
- Continuing analysis
    - Your additional analysis should be reflected in your thesis.
- Source identification
    - Your additional sources should be cited in your essay.

##### :x developing your thesis

Your working thesis from P07 identified what drives the disagreement. Your P08 thesis should reflect what your continued analysis revealed, whether that means refining your P07 identification, explaining what drives it, or reformulating if you discovered something different.

For theoretical disagreements, analysis might identify explicit differences (they define key terms differently, they focus on different aspects of the phenomenon) or explain what drives those differences (implicit assumptions neither author states, structural constraints in their theoretical frameworks, why their positions logically exclude each other).

For empirical disagreements, analysis might identify explicit differences (they interpret the same data differently, they apply different standards for what counts as evidence) or explain what drives those differences (different views of burden of proof, different methodological commitments that produce different interpretations).

Your analysis determines which aspects matter for your case. Not all papers need to address all these possibilities—what matters is accurately explaining the disagreement you discovered.

##### :x how to write your introduction

P07 focused on verification and thesis development without framing. Now that your working thesis has stabilized through peer review, write an introduction that:

- Introduces your reader to the academic conversation (the introduction to the puzzle in P2 can be shorter, with less explanation, than in P1)
- Briefly states the target article's thesis/main conclusion in a way that addresses the puzzle
- Briefly states what the commentary criticizes
- States your thesis about what drives the disagreement
- After the thesis, states a brief significance statement (1-2 sentences) indicating what understanding this disagreement reveals.

Choose your introduction details carefully, with an aim to not overwhelm the reader. Your reader needs orientation to the specific criticism you're analyzing, not a comprehensive explanation of the articles' positions.

##### :x developing your significance discussion

In P05, you answered a question about the significance of the criticism for the target article's argument: what would be the consequences if the commentary is correct? That question focused on whether the commentary's criticism mattered.

Now you must address a _different_ type of significance: what your analysis of why they disagree reveals about how scholars approach this phenomenon, methodology, or the field.

**The connection between thesis and significance:**

Significance flows directly from your thesis. Your thesis identifies what prevents these positions from being compatible (definitions, assumptions, methodological commitments, evidentiary standards). Your significance explains what understanding that incompatibility reveals—what becomes clearer, what becomes more difficult, what research directions this suggests, or what this shows about how scholars approach this phenomenon. A more basic thesis will have more limited significance that addresses what your analysis adds to our understanding of your target and commentary articles, while a more ambitious thesis may have deeper or broader significance for future research, the larger academic conversation, or the phenomenon being explained.

[:Example showing different levels of thesis and significance](#x-example-showing-different-levels-of-thesis-and-significance)

**Placing Your Significance Discussion:**

Your paper should reference significance twice:

1. **Introduction:** After your thesis, include 1-2 sentences previewing what understanding this disagreement reveals
2. **Conclusion:** Develop your full significance discussion here, explaining what understanding why they disagree contributes to the academic conversation

The conclusion is where readers expect to find "so what does this mean?" Your brief introduction mention orients them; your conclusion delivers the full discussion.

###### :x Example showing different levels of thesis and significance

**Limited thesis and significance:**

- Thesis: "They disagree about whether photography qualifies as art; the target argues photography is art, the commentary argues photography is merely mechanical reproduction."
- Significance: "Understanding this disagreement is important because photography is widely used and resolving whether it's art matters for the field."
- Why this fails: This thesis just identifies opposing positions without explaining what drives them, so it doesn't add much to the academic conversation. Thus, the significance claim is limited to stating that the topic is important, without reference to what the paper contributes.

**Satisfactory thesis and significance:**

- Thesis: "They disagree about photography's status as art because they rely on different definitions of art. The target defines on art by aesthetic response while the commentary defines it as an act of creative intention."
- Significance: "Understanding this definitional disagreement reveals that resolving the debate requires prior agreement on whether art is defined by production or reception, not more analysis of photography's features."
- Why this works: The thesis identifies the explicit difference that drives disagreement. The significance explains what this reveals about these authors' frameworks—an article-level observation that's accurate and meaningful but doesn't extend to field-level claims.

**Strong thesis and significance:**

- Thesis: "The commentary characterizes the target as claiming photographers 'create' images, but the target's actual claim is that photographers 'select and frame' existing visual arrangements. This disconnect reveals that the ordinary concept of 'artistic creation' conflates two distinct activities—generating new configurations versus recognizing and isolating existing ones."
- Significance: "Understanding this conceptual ambiguity reveals why debates about photography's artistic status persist despite extensive discussion—the term 'creation' carries unexamined assumptions about what artistic activity involves. This pattern extends to other selection-based practices (found art, readymades, curatorial work), suggesting that progress on this topic requires more specification of the ordinary-language concept of "creating art."
- Why this works: The thesis reveals a conceptual ambiguity that neither author acknowledges but which drives the entire disagreement. The significance extends beyond the particular dispute between the target and commentary articles because it exposes a conceptual problem in the academic conversation as a whole.

##### :x using additional sources appropriately

**Appropriate uses:**

- Provide background on concepts or theories mentioned in articles
- Verify or evaluate specific empirical claims
- Understand technical terms or disciplinary context

**Inappropriate uses:**

- Introduce entirely new arguments not present in your chosen articles
- Substitute for close engagement with target and commentary
- Expand scope beyond your chosen criticism

Keep focus on analyzing the disagreement between target and commentary, using additional sources to support that analysis.

##### :x How to create and use your outline

Create your outline by extracting your thesis and all topic sentences from your draft in order. Use a flat numbered list—no section headers, no sub-numbering. Start with your thesis statement, then list your body paragraph topic sentences in order of appearance. Place the outline on a new page after your Reference list. You don't need to highlight the sentences.

Most essays have 10-15 body paragraphs. If you have more or fewer, check that your paragraphs follow the rule "one idea per paragraph."

[PLACEHOLDER: Add download link to correctly formatted example outline]

Keep the outline updated as you write your full draft. I suggest going back and forth between the two documents (draft and outline) as a way of keeping the big picture in mind.

As you write the draft, regularly read through the outline to check that your argument flows logically and that each paragraph advances your thesis. If you apply the writing guidance taught throughout the course (one idea per paragraph, topic sentences start paragraphs, topic sentences capture the full idea of each paragraph) the outline will fairly represent your essay's argument.

When I give draft feedback before the Week 13 conference, I'll start by commenting on your argument as presented in the outline.
