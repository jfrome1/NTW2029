- to add:
    - attitudinal guidelines
        - focus on understanding why they disagree rather than determining who's right
        - don't assume that one is right and one is wrong, and also don't make the fallacy of assuming that the truth is in the middle / false equivalence
        - try to figure out what is true in the conversation (or what we would need to know to determine truth, or similar)
    - requirement - look at the author's response in addition to the target article and the commentary article

## Purpose

This paper develops your ability to identify and analyze scholarly disagreements in academic conversations. You'll learn how different interpretations of evidence lead to different conclusions and practice evaluating what's at stake in theoretical debates within evolutionary psychology.

## Overview

Write a 2250-2750 word paper that explains and analyzes one specific disagreement between a target article and one of its commentaries. You'll work with one of several provided articles from *Behavioral and Brain Sciences* (BBS), focusing on a limited aspect of the debate rather than the entire article. Your paper will explain both positions, analyze the nature of their disagreement, and optionally discuss its broader significance for the field.

## Requirements

### Source Requirements

Choose one target article and one commentary article from the provided options:

**Target Article Options:**

Use at least two other reputable academic sources (as explained in class) to complement your main sources.

### Content Requirements

Your paper must:

- Explain the target article's main argument
- Identify and explain the specific disagreement with the commentary
- Analyze the nature of the disagreement (evidence interpretation, assumptions, definitions, or methods)
- (Optional) Include advanced analysis that goes beyond basic explanation (see Guidelines)

### Length and Format

- 2250-2750 words
- Follow all standard paper formatting requirements
- Include proper in-text citations and References section
- Highlight thesis in yellow (2 sentences max)
- Highlight topic sentences in body paragraphs in light blue

## Paper 2 Process

Paper 2 develops through a scaffolded sequence of assignments. Each builds toward your final paper:

- **P04: Article Selection** (due Week 9, Oct 15) - Choose your target article and commentary pairing
- **P05: Disagreement Summary** (due Week 10, Oct 21) - Structured worksheet mapping the disagreement
- **P06: Explain Positions** (due Week 10, Oct 26) - 750-word explanation of both positions
- **P07: Working Draft** (due Week 11, Nov 2) - 1500+ word draft adding analysis
- **P08: Full Draft and Outline** (due Week 12, Nov 9) - Complete draft for conference feedback
- **P09: Paper 2 Final** (due Week 13, five days after conference) - Revised final paper

Detailed instructions for each assignment will be provided separately.

## Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. Read the target article once for general understanding
2. Read available commentaries to identify interesting disagreements (recommendations provided in P04)
3. Re-read your chosen target article and commentary, focusing on relevant sections
4. Map out exactly where and how they disagree before writing

Don't try to tackle the entire target article—focus on one specific argument or claim that the commentary challenges.

### Developing Your Ideas

This paper requires a different approach to thesis development than Paper 1:

In most academic papers, you select a thesis and then defend it. In Paper 2, **your thesis should emerge from your analysis of the disagreement**—not vice versa. You can't know what you'll conclude about the disagreement until you've carefully analyzed both positions.

Your original ideas should:

- Come **after** understanding and analyzing the disagreement, not before
- Emerge naturally from your analysis of the papers and their disagreement
- Focus on what you've discovered about **their arguments**, not on developing your own alternative theory

For example:

- **Appropriate**: "The source doesn't support their assumption that group dances require verbal communication to coordinate"
- **Avoid**: "I think group dances evolved for a completely different reason the source doesn't discuss"

The first adds insight about the existing argument. The second creates an entirely new theory that distracts from analyzing the scholarly disagreement.

### Structure and Advanced Analysis

**Basic structure** (required for all papers):

- **Introduction**: Orient reader and state thesis
- **Body Section 1**: Target article's argument
- **Body Section 2**: Commentary's disagreement
- **Body Section 3**: Analysis of disagreement
- **Conclusion**: Summarize disagreement and analysis

These sections may be one or more paragraphs each, depending on your paper's needs.

**Advanced analysis** (optional, demonstrates stronger performance):

Beyond the basic structure, stronger papers may include one or more of these:

- Discuss implications of the disagreement for the field
- Evaluate the significance of the disagreement for the academic conversation
- Identify implicit assumptions underlying the disagreement
- Consider how resolving this disagreement might advance understanding
- Suggest productive paths forward for the debate

Note: You are NOT required to decide who is "right." Focus on understanding and explaining rather than judging.

### Grading Expectations

- **Basic** - Accurately explain both positions and identify the explicit disagreement
- **Good** - Also analyze (potentially implicit) aspects of why the authors disagree (assumptions, definitions, methods, etc.)
- **Better** - Also evaluate the significance of the disagreement for the academic conversation
- **Stretch goal** - Also add to the conversation with original insights (e.g., dissolve disagreement by analyzing implicit assumptions)

## Feedback

You will receive extensive feedback on your P08 full draft during your individual conference. After the conference, you'll have approximately five days to revise based on that feedback before submitting your final paper.
