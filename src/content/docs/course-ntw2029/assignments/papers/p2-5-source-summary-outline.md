## Assignment

### Purpose

This assignment helps you develop a thorough understanding of your primary source's argument before analyzing it in Paper 2. The source summary will help you identify key claims and how they contribute to the academic conversation, while the optional outline provides a more rigorous framework for understanding the logical structure of the source's argument.

### Overview

This assignment has two parts:

1. Required: Write a source summary that clearly explains your source's argument
2. Optional: Create a source summary outline that maps the logical structure of the argument

## Instructions

### Required: Source Summary

1. Begin with the properly formatted APA citation for your source at the top of your document
2. Write a 500-750 word summary that:
   - States the source's main thesis clearly
   - Identifies the key supporting claims/arguments
   - Explains how these claims support the thesis
   - Notes the types of evidence used
   - Describes how the source contributes to its academic conversation
3. Use in-text citations with page numbers when summarizing specific points

### Optional: Source Summary Outline

If you choose to complete this additional component:

1. After your source summary and reference list, start a new page
2. At the top of this page, state the source's thesis (maximum 2 sentences)
3. Create an outline following the [outline guidelines](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/outline-guidelines) covered in class
4. Try to limit your outline to one printed page, single-spaced

## Guidelines

### For the Source Summary

- Organize your summary logically, which may not match the order ideas are presented in the source
- Don't focus on being comprehensive (i.e. don't include every argument or paragraph); some parts of the source may not be relevant to the thesis and shouldn't be included
- Focus on capturing the main points that support the thesis, including all main arguments (not just those you plan to focus on in your paper)
- Pay attention to the relationship between claims and evidence
- Identify any key terms or concepts central to the argument

IMPORTANT: while humanities papers usually put their thesis in the introduction, science papers typically place their conclusions in the Discussion and Conclusion sections, so you'll need to look there to identify the paper's main thesis.

### For the Optional Outline

- If your source has sections or other internal structure, use that structure as a starting point for your outline; otherwise, decide on an appropriate structure based on the argument's logic
- For papers that start with an introduction but don't label it with a heading, add "Introduction: " to your first main point to make this clear
- If your paper has section headings that are not full sentences, you can include those headings before your main points, followed by a statement summarizing that section, for example:
  - Theoretical paper: "3. Cave Music: Evidence suggests that early humans played drums in groups."
  - Empirical paper: "3. Method: The experiment asked subjects to watch a film and comment on their thoughts during viewing."

## Strategy

To identify the main points of your source and differentiate them from less important parts, try to understand the source argument's structure. Ask yourself:

- What is the academic conversation this source is contributing to?
- What is the main question the source aims to answer?
- What new ideas does the source claim to add to the conversation?
- What is the main thesis of the source?
- What are the main points supporting that thesis?
- What kind of examples or evidence does the source use?
- What does the source seem to care most about?
- Who is the source arguing against?

IMPORTANT: Don't answer these questions in your assignment. They are meant to help you identify the overall structure of the source argument so you can better identify the main claims to include in your summary and outline.

## Checklist

### Required Source Summary

- Source citation formatted correctly at the top
- Summary is 500-750 words
- Source thesis clearly stated
- Key supporting claims identified
- Source page numbers cited in-text

### Optional Source Summary Outline

- Appears on a new page after the reference list
- Source thesis clearly stated in 1-2 sentences
- Outline follows all requirements from the outline guidelines
- Outline is limited to approximately one page
- Source page numbers cited in-text (at the end of each outline item)

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist can remind you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it is not a comprehensive summary of all assignment requirements. You must read the complete assignment description to fully understand the requirements.

## Feedback

The main purpose of this assignment is to ~~force~~ encourage you to develop an understanding of your source early in the writing process, not for me to give feedback on whether your summary is correct (I can't do that, as it's impossible for me to read everyone's sources closely at this point). Thus, I'll read and grade all summaries and outlines, but I may or may not make brief comments based on whether I have anything helpful to add.
