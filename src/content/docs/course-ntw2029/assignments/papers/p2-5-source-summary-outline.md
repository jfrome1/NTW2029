## Assignment purpose

This assignment helps you understand the main claims and structure of your source. To Paper 2 requires you to analyze a source argument, and the first step is understanding the argument.

For this assignment, do your best to provide a summary of your main source in outline form, following the detailed instructions below

First, look at a [sample outline here](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/users/90279/files/3878218/download?verifier=xTVJPZcQmMOFBnsfaQ67UmlpkJEEP0FrANrDqjkm&download_frd=1) because it will make the following instructions much easier to understand.

## Logistics

Put the citation for your source at the top as your title. Under it, state the source's thesis (2 sentences maximum, but aim for 1). Then, outline the source using the instructions for the Paper 1 outline (full sentences, no quotations, hierarchical outline, etc.).

Try to limit your summary to one printed page, single-spaced,  to make sure you are not going into too much detail (this is impossible for some longer papers).

Bring 3 hardcopies of this source to class 10.2.

## Guidelines

- If your source has sections or other internal structure, I suggest you use that structure as a starting point for your summary; otherwise, you will decide an appropriate outline structure.
	- Note: sometimes papers start with an introduction but don't label it with a heading. In this case, in your outline, add "Introduction: " to your the first main point to make things clearer.
- If your paper has section headings that are not full sentences, you can put those headings before your main points, but follow them with a statement that summarizes the main point of that section.
	- e.g. theoretical paper: "3. Cave Music: Evidence suggests that early humans played drums in groups."
	- e.g. empirical research paper: "3. Method: the experiment asked subjects to watch a film and comment on their thoughts during viewing."
- Note: science papers do not put their conclusions in the beginning as a thesis. They put hypotheses in the beginning and then tell you whether they think they proved their hypotheses in the Discussion and Conclusion sections. Thus, you will have to look at those sections to find the thesis that you will state at the top of your outline.

## Strategy

Do not focus on being comprehensive (i.e., including every argument in the source or making sure every paragraph is represented in the outline). There might be paragraphs or arguments in the source that are not really relevant to the source thesis, and you should not include these in your outline. Instead, focus on capturing the main points of the argument. Since this outline aims to represent the entire source text, it should cover all main arguments, not just the ones you plan to focus on in your paper. To identify those main points and differentiate them from other parts of the source, you should try to understand the argumentative structure of the source. Ask yourself questions such as:

- What is the academic conversation this source is contributing to?
- What is the main question the source aims to answer?
- What new ideas does the source claim it is adding to the conversation?
- What is the main thesis of the source?
- What are the main points supporting that thesis?
- What kind of examples or evidence does the source use, and what function do they serve?
- What does the source seem to care most about? What is motivating them to write this essay?
- Who is the source arguing against?

IMPORTANT: don't answer the above questions in your assignment. Their purpose is to help you identify the overall structure of the source argument, which will help you better identify the main claims that you will summarize in your outline. The outline should summarize the source's main claims in complete sentences in a hierarchy that reflects the argumentative structure.
