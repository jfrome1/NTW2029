## Exercises

Exercises should be typed directly into the provided text box (unless otherwise indicated).
Include the following information on all exercises (except Exercise 1):

- at the top: the name I call you in class and your section (E1 or E2)
- at the bottom: a word count and a GenAI no-use statement (if you didn't use GenAI)

If you did use GenAI, include the link to your chat transcript at the end of the exercise as described [here](../course-info/gen-ai-policy).

Please do _not_ paste [:links to documents](#x-no-links) in the text box.

# :x no links

## Papers

- These guidelines apply to papers and all paper-related assignments.
- Submit paper assignments as MS Word documents, _not_ a pdf or other file format.
- See an example properly formatted paper [here](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/users/90279/files/3681962/download?verifier=zqjoVhp8AE0JuUtO6eFSQwnNykYu07cySVHXNzNQ&download_frd=1).
- The paper must be double-spaced, left-justified, with numbered pages and standard margins, in 12-point Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman font.
- Leave page headers completely blank/empty. Leave page footers blank except for page numbers.
- Don't use borders, backgrounds, or anything decorative (necessary figures or tables are fine).
- Insert a tab at the beginning of each new paragraph.
- Include in-text citations and a reference list at the end of drafts and final papers. Guidelines are on the [Citations](../course-info) page.
- Follow American Psychological Association (APA) formatting rules for capitalization [(here)](https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/03/title-case-and-sentence-case-capitalization-in-apa-style.HTML) and italics [(here)](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/italics-quotations/italics). Hint: you have to actually click those links and read those pages if you want correct formatting; don't rely on my draft feedback about incorrect formatting.
- Put a word count at the end of the paper, before the reference list.
- The [:paper title](#x-temp) should be centered, separated from the first line of the essay by one line/space, in the same font as the paper body, and not bolded or underlined
- Don't [:skip an extra line](#x-extra-line) between paragraphs.
- Do not use a cover page. Instead, provide the following information at the top left-hand corner of the first page of all paper assignments (not in the header):

```text
Your Name
Prof. Frome - NTW2029
Assignment Name (e.g. Paper 1 draft)
Assignment due date
```

# :x temp

link to be added

# :x extra line

The space between the last line of one paragraph and and the first line of the next should be the same as the space between lines within a paragraph. (Skipping lines between paragraphs can work well for online writing, but not academic essays).

To remove the extra spacing between paragraphs in Microsoft Word:

- Go to the Home tab on the ribbon
- Find the Paragraph section
- Click the little "more" arrow in the lower right corner of the box
- Check/fill the "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style" option
- To make this option your default for new documents, click the box "Set as Default", choose "Set as default for all new documents...", and if you are prompted to save the Normal template, choose to do so
