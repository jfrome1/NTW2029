>
Estimates are fine if you don't have exact times

## Requirements

- Download the [workload report template](/downloads/2510-NTW2029workload.docx)
- Record time spent on this course each week
- Enter hours as numbers only (use `2` not `2 h`)
- Round to the nearest half hour (0.5)
- Class preparation time includes everything you do for class that isn't logged for assignments
- Submit monthly as indicated on the course website schedule
- Submit as `.docx` format only

##### :x why log time

Instructors are told that this course should require an average of 10 hours of work per week, and I want to verify whether I'm meeting this guideline. Your reported hours will not affect your grade in any way, including class participation. I'm not tracking individual student time.
