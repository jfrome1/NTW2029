## Example explanations

As mentioned earlier, I'm providing the below examples in lieu of individualized comments on your submissions. I'm happy to provide individualized feedback on Exercise 4 upon request.

2.7.4 The Thinness of Evolutionary Psychology Explanation

According to Goldfinch, Richardson (2007) thinks evolutionary psychology (EP) explanations are "unconstrained speculation" that are unlikely to ever be confirmed by evidence (64).

According to Goldfinch, Richardson's argument is as follows: To claim a trait is an adaptation is to make the historical claim that the trait became common in a species because it enhanced reproductive fitness in a past environment (65). To validate such a claim (i.e., to provide a complete explanation of a trait) we must do more than just posit a possible scenario in which the trait became widespread, we must show that this scenario actually occurred, using reliable historical information about past populations and environments. [:For example](#x-examples), to validate a adaptation claim, we would need evidence that the trait is heritable, since evolution explains only heritable traits. Further, to completely rule out alternate hypotheses, we would need to know whether the trait actually increased reproductive fitness in the past, which would require evidence about the numbers of offspring created by ancestral individuals with the trait as compared to those without it (65). However, these specifics are lacking, as shown by looking at several well-known examples of EP research (66).

Goldfinch affirms Richardson's argument that EP explanations often lack strong evidential support for some of their claims, noting that this point has been made by EP critics as far back as the 1990s (66, 68). He notes that Richardson goes even further, saying that such evidence is lacking not just in past research, but is likely to be absent in future research as well (67).

2.7.5 [:The Mystery of Discovery](#x-section)

According to Goldfinch, many philosophers dismiss EP based on legitimate concerns that its theories allow multiple, competing hypotheses to be suggested for any given adaptation. Thus, these critics say, EP's ability to explain known [:phenomena](#x-phenomena) is worthless. Further, Goldfinch states, EP can propose many different possible solutions to a given adaptive problem, we cannot rely on its predictive abilities to discover anything new (68-69).

Goldfinch argues that these limitations cause many philosophers to ignore EP's [:"heuristic aspects"](#x-heuristic), a phrase that refers to EP's capacity to suggest hypotheses that would only be developed in light of evolutionary theories. EP often defends its usefulness by arguing that EP-inspired hypotheses have led to discovery of new phenomena. For example, EP defenders say that Cosmides and Tooby (1992) used EP theories to hypothesize that a specialized mechanism for detecting cheaters would be a useful adaptation for species that would benefit from cooperation, and experiments using the Wason Selection Task confirmed this hypothesis in humans [:(69-71)](#x-pages).

Schultz (2011) challenges EP's claims of novel discoveries, Goldfinch states, arguing that, while it is hypothetically possible for EP to discover new things, in actual practice, EP merely explains known phenomena in ways consistent with the theory (71). For example, regarding the cheater detection hypothesis, Schulz argues that the results of the Wason selection task were published in 1966, long before EP developed. Thus, he states, EP merely explained this phenomenon rather than discovering it. Goldfinch notes that Schulz challenges several prominent examples of EP research in the same manner (70-71).

##### :x examples

Here, I provide two examples of the types of evidence that Richardson claims a complete EP explanation would need. In the source, Goldfinch lists five categories of evidence and even more specific examples of evidence. I made a judgement that the reader could understand the objection proposed in this section without knowing all of these details, as the main thrust of the objection is that a complete explanation would require types of evidence that EPs can never obtain. It's less important that the reader learn the exact types discussed in the section unless we intend to analyze each one in our writing.

##### :x section

In the source, Goldfinch relies heavily on ideas he has already discussed, so he is not worried about delivering ideas in the order needed for a generalist reader to understand. Thus, this brief explanation required significant reorganization of ideas. I also chose to include just one of the examples mentioned in the original, believing that it fairly illustrated the general objection outlined in this section.

##### :x phenomena

In this context, phenomena (singular: phenomenon) is just a term meaning "something that happens often enough to be a noticeable type of event"

##### :x heuristic

Here, I expanded the text to explain the notion of "heuristic aspects", which is central to this section.

##### :x pages

Here, I combined a number of ideas from across the section, so my in-text citation covers multiple pages.

| Even if considerations of selection do not guarantee massive modularity in any shape, the possibility remains that there might nevertheless be psychological adaptations and that, accordingly, it might be useful to hypothesise between adaptive problems and possible adaptive solutions. But even this has been challenged. The following objections are activated at different points during the methodological process of hypothesising between adaptive problem and adaptive solutions. And, as we will see, they are legitimate and pressing questions—questions that many have taken to have sufficiently destabilised methodological adaptationism in psychology. | Goldfinch suggests that evolutionary psychology is potentially useful for generating hypotheses to explain organisms' traits. The method is to think of selection pressures as "problems" that can decrease an organism's reproductive fitness and variations in traits as potential "solutions" to those problems that increase reproductive fitness (i.e., allow an organism to reproduce its genes at a higher rate). These problems and solutions can be proposed as testable hypotheses. Goldfinch then describes several objections to this method that many scholars have found to be sufficient reasons to reject evolutionary psychology. |
| 2.7.1 No Stable Problems Objection<br><br>Were adaptive problems sufficiently stable to allow selection to engineer stable solutions? What if the relationship between environments, especially social environments that involve interdependent decision problems, and evolving populations is far more dynamic than evolutionary psychologists realise?<br><br>Sterelny (1995: 372) claims that there are, in fact, 'no stable problems to which natural selection can grind out a solution'. This argument also appears in Sterelny and Griffiths (1999). As you can see, this kind of argument, if successful, would pull the entire rug from underneath evolutionary psychology. The thought is that evolutionary arm races destabilise adaptive problems. And as evolutionary psychology trades on adaptive problems, evolutionary arm races also destabilises evolutionary psychology.<br>An arms race involves feedback: a problem arises, a solution emerges, but the emergence of the solution creates pressure on the original problem, changes it, transforms it, thereby requiring the solution to change, and so on. Sterelny observes that, 'As men evolved to detect ovulation, women evolve to conceal it. As we evolve to detect cheaters and others of uncooperative dispositions, emotion-mimics evolve better and better fakes of a trustworthy and honest face' (1995: 372). So evolutionary psychology methodology seems to trade on an overly simplistic characterisation of evolution, on stable adaptive problems and adaptive problems. How then can that methodology possibly capture this dynamic, this interactive character of evolution?<br><br>Do evolutionary arms races destabilise adaptive problems? I don't believe they do. But I shall leave that issue for the next chapter because it's important to continue building the strongest possible case against methodological adaptationism in psychology. | 2.7.1 No Stable Problems Objection<br><br>Goldfinch asks questions that challenge a certain evolutionary model in which stable environments are said to pose problems for species. Those species solve those problems by evolving traits that better match the stable environments in ways that increase their reproductive fitness. According to Goldfinch, Sterenly challenges this model by arguing that environments actually contain no stable problems. Sterenly argues that species' changing traits also change the environment in which the species evolve. Thus, Sterenly argues, environments contain only dynamic problems, not stable problems as assumed by evolutionary psychology. |
| 2.7.2 The Fine Grain Problem<br><br>So let's assume there are adaptive problems. How coarse are those problems? How do we individuate adaptive problems? How do we characterise them? How do we individuate them?<br><br>The problem of how to individuate correctly domains that specialised adaptations are purported to operate on is what Sterelny and Griffiths (1999) call the 'grain problem'. How coarse or fine is the grain of a domain? How specific is the adaptive problem? Sterelny and Griffiths (1999: 328) ask us to consider the domain of 'mate selection':<br><br>"Is the problem of mate choice a single problem or a mosaic of many distinct problems? These problems might include: When should I be unfaithful to my usual partner? When should I desert my old partner? When should I help my sibs find a partner? When and how should I punish infidelity?"<br><br>The correct identification and characterisation of adaptive problems is not obvious. Is 'mate selection' one adaptive problem, with several sub-problems? Or is 'mate selection' a reference to many distinctive adaptive problems? There seems to be no principled way of answering this. It seems arbitrary. | 2.7.2 The Fine Grain Problem<br><br>Even if there are stable problems that evolution can solve, Goldfinch notes, it is not clear how we decide what counts as one problem vs. several problems. He describes Sterenly and Griffiths' "grain problem" argument: it is impossible to know how detailed or fine-grained evolutionary problems are. For example, they ask whether mate selection is one problem or several distinct sub-problems, each with their own evolutionary solutions. The inability to offer non-arbitrary way to identify problems, they imply, creates a problem for evolutionary psychology. |
| 2.7.3 No Constraints Objection<br><br>But suppose we have fixed the grain of the problem according to our own satisfaction. We can now reason from the adaptive problem to the adaptive solution—or vice versa. But how constrained will our reasoning be? How elastic? In other words, from an adaptive problem can we straightforwardly read off an adaptive solution (or vice versa)? Or will there be many possible reasoning trajectories—perhaps too many? A long standing, deeply entrenched worry in the literature is that the reasoning between adaptive problem and adaptive solution is too elastic. Fitness considerations can be so flexible that it seems possible to reason between adaptive problem A1 and a spectrum of possible adaptive solutions S1, S2, ... Sn. And so too the other way: with sufficient ingenuity, fitness benefits can be imagined for almost any observed behaviour.<br><br>This concern is frequently cashed out into a very strong position: that evolutionary psychology hypotheses are unconstrained, that there is a free for all, a Darwinian Wild West of hypotheses. For example, Richardson declares that 'Just about anything is consistent with some evolutionary model or other' (2007: 65). Gray et al. (2003) approvingly quote Rosen (1982), who quips that there are only two limiting factors that constrain adaptation hypotheses: the imagination of the theorist and the gullibility of the audience.<br><br>So there is indeterminacy with respect to both the grain of the adaptive problem and, more seriously, in the (potentially runaway) multiplicity of possible hypotheses. But let us suppose that we have settled upon a hypothesis. Suppose, despite the indeterminacy, the elasticity, we have arrived at a hypothesis: that adaptive problem A1 is solved by psychological adaptation S1. How good would that be as an explanation? | 2.7.3 No Constraints Objection<br><br>Even if we ignore these two objections and assume that we can hypothesize how adaptive solutions might address adaptive problems, Goldfinch asks how we should limit the types of solutions we propose. He notes a long-standing worry that evolutionary psychology has few limits on the types of explanations it offers for how traits might be adaptive since there are so many ways that traits might affect organisms' fitness. |
