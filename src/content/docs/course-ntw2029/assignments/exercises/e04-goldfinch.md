## Assignment purpose

This assignment is the step in learning to explain (summarize and explicate) a complex text. This text is more complex than the last, and the challenge is less about deciding what parts of the text to include and more about understanding the argument well enough to explain it.

This assignment is optional. You can request an extension. If you complete it, you will receive feedback and points. If not, this assignment's points will be excluded when calculating your grade.

### Goals

- read and understand the text
- summarize the main argument
- identify and explicate any ideas that your target audience would not otherwise understand
- properly attribute ideas to their sources

## Instructions

<!-- Explain either section 2.7.4 (Group A) or 2.7.5 (Group B) of Goldfinch, Andrew. _Rethinking Evolutionary Psychology_. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015. I will assign you to Group A or Group B in class. The explanation should not have an introduction or a conclusion. Citations are not necessary for this exercise. Keep your submission under 500 words.

Explain either section 2.7.4 or 2.7.5 (your choice) of Goldfinch, Andrew. _Rethinking Evolutionary Psychology_. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015. The explanation should not have an introduction or a conclusion. Citations are not necessary for this exercise. Keep your submission under 500 words.

## Guidance

Your goal is to explain the main points of a section of Goldfinch for your target audience. Shorten the text by leaving out out details not necessary for the reader to understand the overall argument. Expand the text to explicate ideas, assumptions, and other elements that are crucial to the argument but are not clearly explained by Goldfinch in a way your audience would understand.

This reading comes from a book by an academic publisher, written for other academics who are at least somewhat familiar with the topic. You may find the text challenging!

Don't assume that you should explain each paragraph and present the information in the same order as the original. Think about what is and isn't needed to explain these pages to your reader so they understand Goldfinch's main points.

Make sure to properly attribute all ideas to their source rather than writing them as if they are your original ideas. In this case, it is harder, because Goldfinch is explaining what other people have said. Thus, don't write, "Claims about adaptive traits..." or "Richardson argues that claims about adaptive traits..." but "According to Goldfinch, Richardson argues that claims about adaptive traits...". It's hard to do this gracefully, so don't worry about it too much for this exercise.

## Feedback

For this exercise, after the submission deadline, I'll post an example explanation on this page for you to compare to your submission. I'll also make brief individualized comments with suggestions for writing improvement. You are welcome to ask for additional feedback either in an in-person meeting or by posing specific questions via Canvas comments or email.
