## Purpose

This exercise encourages you to critically reflect on how you approached Paper 2 and what you learned from the writing process. These reflections will help you identify your strengths, challenges, and strategies for analyzing scholarly disagreements in future academic work.

## Overview

Answer the following questions about your writing process, from initial reading through final revisions. Submit your responses one day after your Paper 2 final is due. Answers can be as long or short as needed—there are no length requirements.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the following questions into a document and type answers below each question, in full sentences:

1. What aspects of this paper represent improvements in your writing skills compared to previous papers you've written? How are those improvements reflected?
2. How did your understanding of the disagreement between your target article and your commentary article change from your first reading to your final draft? What caused that shift?
3. What guidance would you give future students about strategies to use and to avoid in writing this paper?
4. What parts of your paper are you most proud of and why?
5. What aspect of Paper 2 (from any assignment P04-P09) was most challenging to fulfill? Do you have any suggestions for how to make this aspect easier for future students?
6. What's one thing you now know about analyzing scholarly disagreements that you didn't know before writing this paper?
7. Paper 2 asks you to explain both positions accurately without arguing for one side. Where in your writing process did you find this most difficult, and what did you do about it?
8. You'll encounter scholarly disagreements in future courses. Based on writing this paper, what's your plan for approaching them?
9. Do you have any suggestions about how to make the P2 assignment more effective as a learning experience?
10. What were the one or two most significant things you learned in or skills you developed in this course?

Include a GenAI link/non-use statement (required) but not a word count.

## Guidelines

- Be honest in your self-assessment—these answers won't affect your paper grade
- Don't try to present a curated image of yourself as a writer; you'll benefit most from genuine reflection
- When discussing challenges, be specific about what made them difficult
- For questions about the assignment sequence (P04-P09), reference specific exercises if relevant
- For questions about strategies and plans, provide concrete approaches rather than general intentions

## Feedback

This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your writing development process and help improve the course for future students.
