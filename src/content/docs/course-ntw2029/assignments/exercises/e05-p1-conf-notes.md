# Exercise 5 - Paper 1 Conference Summary

## Purpose

This exercise helps you consolidate feedback from our conference and create an action plan for revising your draft. By articulating the key points from our discussion, you'll better internalize the feedback and develop a clear revision strategy.

## Overview

Answer the following questions about the conference feedback and your revision plans.

## Instructions

Copy and paste the following questions into a document and type answers below each question:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your draft?
2. What other points of feedback were discussed?
3. What are your planned next steps for revising your draft?
4. Are there any next steps that you don't currently know how to make progress on? Do you have questions about them or do you know what to do?
5. (optional) Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback?

Include a GenAI link/non-use statement (required) but not a word count.

## Guidelines

- Be specific when describing feedback pointsâ€”reference particular sections or issues in your draft
- Your revision plans should focus on the most important planned changes (you don't need to address every point of feedback) but be detailed in describing your plans for the points you do address (e.g. not "revise introduction" but "revise introduction to make sure the introduction does [function 1] and [function 2]")
- If you're uncertain about how to address feedback, use question 4 to clarify
- After this conference, you can ask specific questions about particular parts of the paper via email or messaging as time allows, or schedule additional meetings during the week
- Note: I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts or respond to general questions such as "is this ok?"

## Feedback

You'll receive completion credit for thoughtful responses. This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your writing development process.
