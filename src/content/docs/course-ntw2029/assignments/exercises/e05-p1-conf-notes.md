title: Exercise 5 - P02 Conference report
date: 2024-08-13
---
## Purpose

This exercise helps you consolidate feedback from our conference and create an action plan for revising your draft. By articulating the key points from our discussion, you'll better internalize the feedback and develop a clear revision strategy.

## Overview

Answer the following questions about the conference feedback and your revision plans.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the following questions into a document and type answers below each question, in full sentences:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your draft?
2. What other points of feedback were discussed?
3. What are your planned next steps for revising your draft?
4. Are there any next steps that you don't currently know how to make progress on?
5. (optional) Do you have any other comments or feedback?

Include a GenAI link/non-use statement (required) but not a word count.

## Guidelines

- Be specific when describing feedback points—reference particular sections or issues in your draft
- Your answer to question 3 should focus on the most important planned changes--you don't need to address every point of feedback--but don't be vague and formulate an actual, specific plan (e.g. not "I plan to revise the introduction" but "I plan to revise the introduction to make sure it does [function 1] and [function 2]")

### Getting help

- Don't ask me questions in this assignment; if you want me to answer, email or message me separately
- After this conference, I encourage questions about your revision process. See [what kinds of questions I can answer](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences#what-counts-as-a-specific-question) and [why I can't review emailed draft sections](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences#can-i-email-you-my-revisions-for-more-feedback).

## Feedback

This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your writing development process.
