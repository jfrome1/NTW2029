## Assignment purpose

Almost every piece of writing advice I will give you in this course relates to one of two ideas:

- academic writing can be thought of as a conversation
- the writer's job is to make their reader's job as effortless as possible

This assignment relates to the latter idea and will give you practice thinking about your writing from a reader's perspective.

### Goals

- practice specific descriptions
- adopt the reader's perspective
- identify elements of the explanation that a non-expert reader would not understand
- expand on confusing elements in a way that the reader would understand
- test your assumptions about reader knowledge against actual reader feedback

## Instructions

This assignment has four required parts that you'll submit together:

### Part 1: The Explanation (300 words or less)

Write an explanation of how to do something. Your imagined reader is a classmate who has no familiarity with your topic. You will have to explain how to do this thing in 300 words or less, with no pictures or diagrams.

Following the exercise guidelines, do not include a typical essay introduction or conclusion for this exercise, but do briefly orient your reader by providing context for your explanation. Why would they want to learn how to do this thing? Set the context, explain how to do the thing, and end briefly with any useful final information.

For this exercise, start with a title that makes clear what you will explain.

### Part 2: Your Predictions

After writing your explanation, list exactly 3 areas where you think your reader is most likely to misunderstand or struggle. Be specific about which parts of your explanation might cause confusion.

Format this as:
1. [Direct quote from essay] - [Why reader might struggle]
2. [Direct quote from essay] - [Why reader might struggle]
3. [Direct quote from essay] - [Why reader might struggle]

### Part 3: Actual Reader Feedback

Show your explanation to a friend who is genuinely unfamiliar with your topic (e.g., don't show a recipe to someone who already knows how to cook). Ask them to read it carefully and to imagine doing it. Then, ask them to identify 1-3 specific places where they might be confused about what to do or how to do it.

Report their feedback exactly as given. Format this like the above, using direct quotes and reporting your friend's feedback.

Note: Your friend must identify at least one point of confusion but doesn't need to find three if they think the explanation is really clear.

### Part 4: Reflection

Give a short (one paragraph) reflection on any differences between your predictions and actual reader feedback. Anything is fine; it doesn't have to provide deep insights.

## Guidance

### Choosing your topic

Pick something based on your own knowledge and skills and of an appropriately narrow scope, such as:

- how to teach a dog to roll over
- how to calibrate a home 3D printer
- how to tune up brakes on a bicycle
- how to mix colors when painting with watercolor

Pick something that you know how to do but that most people in this class won't know how to do. It should be something that you took lessons for, or had to be explicitly taught, or had to teach yourself using a tutorial or instruction manual. Due to the word limit, pick something small within your larger area of expertise. For example, "how to dance" is too broad, but "how to do the dance move called 'flossing'" might work.

### Red flag phrases to avoid

Watch for these phrases in your writing - they often signal you're assuming too much reader knowledge:

- "Simply" or "just" (as in "just fold the paper")
- Directional terms without clear reference points ("the right side," "turn it over")
- Technical terms without definitions
- "As usual" or "normally"

### Think of your reader

Make sure that you think of your reader while writing your explanation. What would an average NUSC first-year student know about your topic already? What terms or concepts would they need explained?

After reading your explanation, your reader should be able to do the thing you explain (even if at a beginner level). It's not enough if they just know the steps involved in the task but can't actually perform those steps. For difficult actions, don't just say what to do, but explain how to do it.

Along these lines, it's best not to pick something that is easy to describe but hard to do, like playing an instrument. You can explain, "to play piano, hit the keys in the right order with the right timing and rhythm", but that doesn't actually help your reader.

## GenAI submission requirement

To make sure everyone knows how to submit GenAI links, review the GenAI policy and submit a chat link on this assignment, even if you don't use GenAI in any significant way.

## Feedback

For this assignment, I'll provide brief feedback and see if my view matches your friend's view.

## Example

Here is an example submission to give you some idea what is expected for Part 1:

### **How to Format Webpage Text Using Markdown**

Markdown is a computer language widely used for formatting text on the web. Users can write documents in Markdown and software will convert (or "render") them into the universal web language, HTML, that all webpages use. Markdown is much easier to learn than HTML, and it has the advantage that its files are easy for people to read and understand. Markdown files are also are small and can be read on any computer system.

Markdown's advantage over plain text alone is that it provides a way to format text and add web functions to the rendered webpages by adding specific characters before and after words. For example, to create bold text in Markdown, use double asterisks or double underscores around the text you want to emphasize. Typing `**bold text**` or `__bold text__` in a Markdown document will render the webpage text as **bold text**. Italicizing text is similarly straightforward. By enclosing the text in single asterisks or underscores, you can make it italic. For example, writing `*italic text*` or `_italic text_` will display as _italic text_. Strikethrough text, which indicates deletion or irrelevance, can be achieved by enclosing the text in double tildes. For example, `~~strikethrough text~~` will render as ~~strikethrough text~~.

You can create and edit a Markdown document using any text editor, but to convert the document into an HTML webpage, you will need a Markdown editor. Popular free editors include Obsidian, VS Code, and Zettlr.
