## Purpose

This assignment gives you practice thinking about your writing from a reader's perspective. You'll learn to identify where readers might struggle with your explanations and test your assumptions about reader knowledge against actual reader feedback.

## Overview

Write a 300-word explanation of how to do something, predict where readers might struggle, and collect actual reader feedback. Your submission will have three parts: the explanation itself, your predictions about confusion points, and a friend's actual feedback about unclear sections.

## Instructions

This assignment has three required parts that you'll submit together:

### Part 1: The Explanation (300 words or less)

Write an explanation of how to do something. Your imagined reader is a classmate who has no familiarity with your topic. You will have to explain how to do this thing in 300 words or less, with no pictures or diagrams.

Do not include a typical essay introduction or conclusion for this exercise, but do briefly orient your reader by providing context for your explanation. Why would they want to learn how to do this thing? Set the context, explain how to do the thing, and end briefly with any useful final information.

Start with a title that makes clear what you will explain.

### Part 2: Your Predictions

After writing your explanation, list exactly 3 areas where you think your reader is most likely to misunderstand or struggle. Be specific about which parts of your explanation might cause confusion.

Format this as:

1. [Direct quote from essay] - [Why reader might struggle]
2. [Direct quote from essay] - [Why reader might struggle]
3. [Direct quote from essay] - [Why reader might struggle]

### Part 3: Actual Reader Feedback

Show your explanation to a friend who is genuinely unfamiliar with your topic (e.g., don't show a recipe to someone who already knows how to cook). Ask them to read it carefully and to imagine doing it. Then, ask them to identify 1-3 specific places where they might be confused about what to do or how to do it.

Report their feedback exactly as given. Format this like the above, using direct quotes and reporting your friend's feedback.

Note: Your friend must identify at least one point of confusion but doesn't need to find three if they think the explanation is really clear.

## Guidelines

### Choosing Your Topic

Pick something based on your own knowledge and skills and of an appropriately narrow scope, such as:

- how to teach a dog to roll over
- how to calibrate a home 3D printer
- how to tune up brakes on a bicycle
- how to mix colors when painting with watercolor

Pick something that you know how to do but that most people in this class won't know how to do. It should be something that you took lessons for, or had to be explicitly taught, or had to teach yourself using a tutorial or instruction manual. Due to the word limit, pick something small within your larger area of expertise. For example, "how to dance" is too broad, but "how to do the dance move called 'flossing'" might work.

### Red Flag Phrases to Avoid

Watch for these phrases in your writing - they often signal you're assuming too much reader knowledge:

- "Simply" or "just" (as in "just fold the paper")
- Directional terms without clear reference points ("the right side," "turn it over")
- Technical terms without definitions
- "As usual" or "normally"

### Think of Your Reader

Make sure that you think of your reader while writing your explanation. What would an average NUSC first-year student know about your topic already? What terms or concepts would they need explained?

After reading your explanation, your reader should be able to do the thing you explain (even if at a beginner level). It's not enough if they just know the steps involved in the task but can't actually perform those steps. For difficult actions, don't just say what to do, but explain how to do it.

It's best not to pick something that is easy to describe but hard to do, like playing an instrument. You can explain, "to play piano, hit the keys in the right order with the right timing and rhythm", but that doesn't actually help your reader.

## Feedback

For this assignment, I'll provide brief feedback and see if my view matches your friend's view.

## GenAI Submission Requirement
