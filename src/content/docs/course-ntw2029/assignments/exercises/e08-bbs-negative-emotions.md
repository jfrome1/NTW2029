date: 2025-10-02

## Purpose

This exercise develops your ability to distinguish between existing explanations and new proposals in academic conversations. You'll practice identifying what scholars previously believed about a phenomenon and how new research challenges those beliefs.

## Overview

You will answer questions about Menninghaus et al.'s article on negative emotions in art and one critical commentary article. The target article tackles a puzzle: why do we enjoy art that makes us feel sad, scared, or disgusted?

## Requirements

### Reading

Read (at least) the following parts of "The Distancing-Embracing Model of the Enjoyment of Negative Emotions in Art Reception" (Menninghaus et al., 2017):

- Abstract (in full)
- Section 1, "Introduction" (in full, be sure to examine  Figure 1 and read its captions)
- Section 2, "The goals of art, characteristics of negative emotions, and their strong role in artworks" (first paragraph only [starts "Ever since Greek and Latin antiquity..."], ends 2 lines into p. 5)
- Section 3, "Cognitive mechanisms that keep negative emotions at a psychological distance: The Distancing factor" (two paragraphs of intro only, no subsections)
- Section 4, "How the arts of selecting, combining, and formally elaborating constituent parts of artworks promote the enjoyment of negative emotions: The Embracing factor"  (two paragraphs of intro, first 2 paragraphs of subsection 4.1)
- One subsection of 4.2 (your choice, see question 2 below)

Also read the commentary article "'Negative emotions' live in stories, not in the hearts of readers who enjoy them" (Konecni, 2017) on pp. 32-33.

### Questions

Copy and paste the following questions into a document and type answers below each question, in full sentences. Include page numbers for any quotations. No word count requirements.

1. Academic conversation about a puzzling phenomenon: What's the "paradox of negative emotions in art"? Give two specific examples of art forms where this happens.

2. Conversation so far (the source's "they say"): How have others attempted to explain this phenomenon? Using the authors' description of existing theories, pick ONE existing theory explaining the paradox of negative emotions from ONE of the following sections 4.2.1 (sadness), 4.2.2 (horror), or 4.2.3 (disgust). What does this theory claim and why do the authors think it's insufficient?

3. What the source is adding: (the source's "I say"): How does the target article claim to add to the conversation? In your own words, explain the two key parts of the Distancing-Embracing Model (or DEM). Focus on explaining these components in general and don't name or discuss all of their subparts. (Optional - identify what the authors claim is the benefit of the DEM over existing theories).

4. Finding disagreement: Explain one of Konecni's criticisms of the target article. Quote a sentence from the commentary that shows the disagreement and explain the quotation in your own words.

5. Understanding disagreement: If you can, try to explain what is underlying the disagreement you explained. What is the disagreement underlying the criticism? Do they disagree about, for example, the nature of emotion? The purpose of art? What "distance" means? Something else?

## Guidelines

- Aim to understand the big picture, not the details. What is the basic idea of the DEM?
- Skip (for now):
    - Author biographies on page 2
    - Detailed research studies and examples

## Feedback

This exercise won't receive individual comments, but we'll discuss the answers in class 8.1.
