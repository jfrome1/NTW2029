## Purpose

This exercise develops your ability to distinguish between existing explanations and new proposals in academic conversations. You'll practice identifying what scholars previously believed about a phenomenon and how new research challenges those beliefs.

## Overview

Answer questions about Menninghaus et al.'s article on negative emotions in art. This article tackles a puzzle: why do we enjoy art that makes us feel sad, scared, or disgusted? You'll identify both the old explanations and their new model. We'll discuss these in class 8.1.

## Requirements

### Reading

Read the following sections from "The Distancing-Embracing Model of the Enjoyment of Negative Emotions in Art Reception" (Menninghaus et al., 2017):

- Abstract (full)
- Pages 1-6 (Introduction through section 2.3)
- Pages 11-12 (section 3.1 - The Distancing-Embracing Model)
- Pages 19-20 (section 5 - Conclusion)

Also read the commentary article "Emotional granularity and the musical
Enjoyment of sadness itself" (Barrett et al., 2017) on pp. 18-19.

### Questions

Copy and paste the following questions into a document and type answers below each question, in full sentences:

1. **The puzzle everyone agrees on**: What's the "paradox of negative emotions in art"? Give two specific examples of art forms where this happens. (2-3 sentences)

2. **OLD explanations (what "they say")**: Pick ONE compensatory theory from section 2 (e.g., catharsis, sublimity, or suspense). What does this theory claim and why do the authors think it's insufficient? Include page reference. (3-4 sentences)

3. **NEW explanation (what "we say")**: In your own words, what are the two key components of the Distancing-Embracing Model? Don't just name them—explain what each means. (3-4 sentences)

4. **Finding disagreement**: Based on the Barrett et al. commentary, what specific aspect of the DEM model does the commentary question or challenge? Quote one sentence from the commentary that shows the disagreement and explain the quotation in your own words. (2-3 sentences)

5. **Why this matters**: According to the conclusion (pp. 19-20), what's at stake in getting this right? Why do the authors think understanding negative emotions in art is important? (2-3 sentences)

Include page numbers for any quotations.

## Guidelines

- For question 2, don't try to explain all the compensatory theories—pick the one that makes most sense to you
- The DEM model might seem complex, but focus on the basic idea: we need both distance and embracing for negative emotions to be enjoyable
- This is practice for Paper 2, where you'll analyze similar disagreements in detail

## Feedback

This exercise won't receive individual comments, but we'll discuss your understanding in class 8.1. Focus on comprehension rather than evaluation—save your critiques for later assignments.
