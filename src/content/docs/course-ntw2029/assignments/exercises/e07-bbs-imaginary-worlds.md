## Purpose

This exercise helps you develop the skill of reading a complex academic paper to understand the academic conversation.

## Overview

Answer the following questions about the assigned reading. Answers can be as long or short as neededâ€”there are no length requirements. We will discuss these and other questions about the reading in class 7.2.

## Instructions

Read "Why imaginary worlds? The psychological foundations and cultural evolution of fictions with imaginary worlds" (Dubourg & Baumard, 2022), following this guide:

- Abstract (full)
- Pages 1-3 (Introduction & section 2)
- Pages 4-5 (section 3 - just first and last paragraphs)
- Pages 63-65 (Author's Response sections R1.1, R1.1.1, R1.1.2, and R1.2)
- Skim the rest of the article by just reading topic sentences
- (Recommended) search for (Ctrl+F) and read sentences with "we argue that", "we propose", and "we hypothesize"

## Requirements

Copy and paste the following questions into a document and type answers below each question, in full sentences:

1. The phenomenon: What specific success/trend about imaginary worlds do the authors document? (pp. 1-2, give 2 examples of this trend)
2. The "they say": According to the Author's Response (pp. 64-65), what is the "information hypothesis" that other scholars believe about why we consume fiction? Why do D&B think this explanation fails for imaginary worlds specifically?
3. Their "I say": What do D&B propose instead? Find their main claim in the abstract about exploration preferences.
4. Key definition: How do they distinguish "imaginary worlds" from other fictional settings like Balzac's novels? (pp. 2-3)
5. The evolutionary argument: On page 65, they discuss fiction as "entertainment" vs "information." Which side do they take and why does this matter for imaginary worlds with impossible elements (flying broomsticks, dragons)?

Provide an in-text citation (page number only--I know the authors and date) for any quotations you include in your answers.

Include a GenAI link/non-use statement (required) but not a word count.

## Guidelines

Do not worry about providing wrong answers. This assignment is for you to practice reading something really complex and to make sure you know the article well enough to contribute in the class 7.2 group activities.

## Feedback

This exercise won't receive individual comments, but you will get feedback on your understanding in the 7.2 activity and discussion.
