title: Exercise 09 - Origin of Music

## Purpose

This exercise develops your ability to understand how scholars position new theories against existing explanations. You'll practice identifying what existing theories claim ("they say"), what new theories propose ("I say"), and evaluating the arguments used to challenge competing explanations, which are essential skills for Paper 2.

## Overview

You will read selected sections from two articles about music's evolutionary origins and answer questions about how they explain the same phenomenon differently. Both articles address why music exists universally across cultures despite having no obvious survival benefit, but they propose different theories and challenge different existing explanations.

## Instructions

First, read "Music as a coevolved system for social bonding" (Savage et al., 2021):

- Abstract (full)
- Section 1, "Introduction" (full)
- Section 2, "Social bonding as a unifying function" (intro paragraphs only, before subsection 2.1 begins)
- Section 2.1, "Ancestral bonding mechanisms" (full)

Then, read "Origins of music in credible signaling" (Mehr et al., 2021):

- Abstract (full)
- Introduction (pp. 23-24, up to section 3)
- Section 3.1, "The byproduct hypothesis fails..." (full)
- Section 3.2 (full)
- Skip section 3.2.1 (you may skim the first paragraph for context if desired)
- Section 3.2.2, "The social bonding hypothesis conflates proximate- and ultimate-level reasoning" (full)
- Section 3.2.3, "Music is poorly designed to coordinate groups" (full)

## Requirements

Copy and paste the following questions into a document and type answers below each question, in full sentences. Keep the questions numbered. Include page numbers for any quotations. No word count requirements.

1. The puzzle: Both articles address the same evolutionary puzzle about music. What is it? Why is this puzzling from an evolutionary perspective?

2. Savage's "I say": Explain the social bonding hypothesis in your own words. What problem does Savage claim this theory solves that wasn't solved by earlier primate bonding mechanisms like grooming?

3. Mehr's "they say": Before proposing his own theory, Mehr challenges two existing theories: the byproduct theory (Pinker and others) and the social bonding theory (Savage and others). For each theory, state what that theory claims about music's origins.

4. Mehr challenges byproduct: Mehr presents six arguments against the byproduct hypothesis (section 3.1). Choose the TWO arguments you find most persuasive. For each, briefly explain: (a) what the argument claims, and (b) why you find it persuasive or what makes it strong.

5. Mehr challenges social bonding: Explain Mehr's free-rider critique in section 3.2.2 (see guidelines below for help). According to Mehr, how do thees explanations confuse proximate with ultimate causes? What is their point about free-riders and how does it challenge the social bonding hypothesis?

6. Evaluating efficiency: In section 3.2.3, Mehr argues music is "poorly designed" for group coordination compared to language. Explain his reasoning using the coxswain example. Do you find this argument persuasive? Why or why not?

7. Finding gaps: Choose ONE of Mehr's critiques (from 3.1, 3.2.2, or 3.2.3) and identify one assumption he makes or one piece of evidence he would need to make his argument stronger. Use this template: "Mehr argues that [X] proves [Y], but this assumes [Z is true / doesn't explain why W]."

Include a GenAI link/non-use statement (required) but not a word count.

## Guidelines

- Focus on understanding how the arguments fit into the academic conversation
- For question 5, recall Boyd's discussion of cooperation and free-riders. Also, note that proximate explanations of a trait describe how a trait works biologically (i.e., what is the mechanism causing the stimuli to produce the effect) while ultimate explanations describe why a trait evolved (i.e., what adaptive problem it solved)
- For question 6, think about whether cost always equals poor designâ€”are there benefits to costly signals?

## Feedback

This exercise won't receive individual comments, but you will get feedback on your understanding in the 8.2 activity and discussion.
