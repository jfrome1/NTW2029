## Purpose

This exercise develops your ability to understand how scholars position new theories against existing explanations. You'll practice identifying what existing theories claim ("they say"), what new theories propose ("I say"), and evaluating the arguments used to challenge competing explanations—essential skills for Paper 2.

## Overview

You will read selected sections from two articles about music's evolutionary origins and answer questions about how they explain the same phenomenon differently. Both articles address why music exists universally across cultures despite having no obvious survival benefit, but they propose different theories and challenge different existing explanations.

## Requirements

### Reading

Read the following sections in this order:

**First, read Savage et al. (2021), "Music as a coevolved system for social bonding":**

- Abstract (full)
- Section 1, "Introduction" (full)
- Section 2, "Social bonding as a unifying function" (intro paragraphs only, before subsection 2.1 begins)
- Section 2.1, "Ancestral bonding mechanisms" (full)

**Then, read Mehr et al. (2021), "Origins of music in credible signaling":**

- Abstract (full)
- Introduction (pp. 23-24, up to section 3)
- Section 3.1, "The byproduct hypothesis fails..." (full)
- Section 3.2 (full)
- Section 3.2.2, "The social bonding hypothesis conflates proximate- and ultimate-level reasoning" (full)
- Section 3.2.3, "Music is poorly designed to coordinate groups" (full)
- **Skip section 3.2.1** (you may skim the first paragraph for context if desired)

### Questions

Copy and paste the following questions into a document and type answers below each question, in full sentences. Include page numbers for any quotations or specific references.

1. **The puzzle**: Both articles address the same evolutionary puzzle about music. What is it? Why is this puzzling from an evolutionary perspective?

2. **Savage's "I say"**: Explain the social bonding hypothesis in your own words. What problem does Savage claim this theory solves that wasn't solved by earlier primate bonding mechanisms like grooming?

3. **Mehr's "they say"**: Before proposing his own theory, Mehr challenges two existing theories. For EACH theory below, state what that theory claims about music's origins:
   - The byproduct theory (Pinker and others)
   - The social bonding theory (Savage and others)

4. **Mehr challenges byproduct**: Mehr presents six arguments against the byproduct hypothesis (section 3.1). Choose the TWO arguments you find most persuasive. For each, briefly explain: (a) what the argument claims, and (b) why you find it persuasive or what makes it strong.

5. **Mehr challenges social bonding**: Explain Mehr's free-rider critique in section 3.2.2. According to Mehr, why would natural selection favor individuals whose brains don't release endorphins during music? How does this challenge the social bonding hypothesis?

6. **Evaluating efficiency**: In section 3.2.3, Mehr argues music is "poorly designed" for group coordination compared to language. Explain his reasoning using the coxswain example. Do you find this argument persuasive? Why or why not?

7. **Finding gaps**: Choose ONE of Mehr's critiques (from 3.1, 3.2.2, or 3.2.3) and identify one assumption he makes or one piece of evidence he would need to make his argument stronger. Use this template: "Mehr argues that [X] proves [Y], but this assumes [Z is true / doesn't explain why W]."

Include a GenAI link/non-use statement (required) but not a word count.

## Guidelines

- Focus on understanding how the arguments fit into the academic conversation
- For question 5, recall Boyd's discussion of cooperation and free-riders
- For question 6, think about whether cost always equals poor design—are there benefits to costly signals?
- For question 7, you're practicing the critical thinking you'll need for Paper 2

## Feedback

This exercise will receive completion credit only. We'll discuss your answers in class 9.1, focusing on how scholars challenge competing theories and how to evaluate evolutionary arguments for Paper 2.
