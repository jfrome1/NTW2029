title: Exercise 6 - Paper 1 writing reflection
date: 2024-08-13
---

## Purpose

This exercise encourages you to critically reflect on how you approached Paper 1 and what you learned from the writing process. These reflections will help you identify your strengths, challenges, and strategies to apply to future writing.

## Overview

Answer the following questions about your writing process, from initial drafting through final revisions. Submit your responses one day after your Paper 1 final is due. Answers can be as long or short as needed—there are no length requirements.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the questions below into a document and type your answer below each question, in full sentences. Keep the question numbered:

1. What parts of your paper are you most proud of and why?
2. What parts of the paper do you think still need improvement and why?
3. What were the two or three biggest changes you made on your draft after our conference?
4. Did you use ChatGPT? If yes, how did you do so and how helpful was it?
5. Did you consult others for feedback? If yes, how did you do so and how helpful was it?
6. Was there any specific aspect of writing (e.g. topic sentences, illustrative examples, unclear referents) that you found particularly challenging to deal with?
7. In general, what was the biggest challenge in writing this paper?
8. What did you learn from writing this paper that you will apply to future writing assignments?

Include a GenAI link/non-use statement (required) but not a word count.

## Guidelines

- Be honest in your self-assessment—these answers won't affect your paper grade
- Don't try to present a curated image of yourself as a writer; you'll benefit most from genuine reflection
- When discussing challenges, be specific about what made them difficult
- For questions about tools and resources (4-6), provide enough detail that I can understand how you used them

## Feedback

This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your writing development process.
