## Purpose

This exercise helps you consolidate guidance from our conference on your Paper 2 full draft. By articulating what you learned in the conference, you'll better internalize key revisions and develop a clear strategy for your P2 final draft.

## Overview

To capture the key insights and guidance from the conference, answer the following questions about the conference and your revision plans for Paper 2.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the questions below into a document and type your answer below each question, in full sentences. Keep the question numbered:

1. **What were the 2 or 3 most important issues with your draft?** Be specific about what needed clarification, revision, or rethinking.

2. **Did we discuss problems with how you explained the disagreement between the target and commentary?** If so, what needs to be clearer or more specific about what makes their positions incompatible? If not, write "No explanation issues discussed."

3. **Did we identify terminology, concepts, or distinctions you need to clarify?** If so, which terms or concepts, and how should you handle them? If not, write "No terminology issues discussed."

4. **Did we discuss issues with your topic sentences or paragraph organization?** If so, what specific changes should you make to improve argument flow or clarity? If not, write "No organization issues discussed."

5. **What is your main revision priority based on the conference?** Describe the single most important change or improvement you plan to make.

6. **(Optional)** Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for me?

## Guidelines

- Be specific in your answers
- Since it's hard to remember everything discussed in the conference, I encourage you to review the conference transcript while answering these questions

### Getting help

- Don't ask me questions in this assignment; if you want me to answer, email or message me separately
- After this conference, I encourage questions about your revision process. See [what kinds of questions I can answer](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences#what-counts-as-a-specific-question) and [why I can't review emailed draft sections](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences#can-i-email-you-my-revisions-for-more-feedback).

## Feedback

This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your writing development process.
