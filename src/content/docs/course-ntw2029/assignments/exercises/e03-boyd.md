## Assignment purpose

The goal of this assignment is to give you practice explaining (summarizing and explicating) a complex text.

## Instructions

Explain the first four pages (51-55) of Boyd's chapter, "The Evolution of Cooperation" in _On the Origin of Stories: Evolution, Cognition, and Fiction_. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009. You do not need to read or explain any crossed-out text. Make sure to properly attribute Boyd's ideas to Boyd. The explanation should not have an introduction or a conclusion. Citations are not necessary for this exercise. Keep your submission under 500 words.

## Guidance

Your goal is to explain the main points of Boyd's argument in the first part of the text for your target audience. Shorten the text by leaving out out details not necessary for the reader to understand the overall argument. Expand the text to explicate ideas, assumptions, and other elements that are crucial to the argument but are not clearly explained by Boyd in a way your audience would understand.

The reading comes from a popular science book, written by an academic, intended for a general audience. It was on the _New York Times_ bestseller list for many weeks (its popularity doesn't say anything about the quality or weakness of its arguments; I'm just trying to give you context for the intended reader).

Don't assume that you should explain each paragraph and present the information in the same order as the original. Think about what is and isn't needed to explain these pages to your reader so they understand Boyd's main points.

## Feedback

For this exercise, you will receive indirect feedback when we discuss Boyd's arguments. I will also provide an example explanation on this page that you can compare to your submission. Individualized comments are not planned.

## Checklist

- Explain the first four pages of the text to your target audience
- Properly attribute all ideas to their source (citation is not needed for this exercise)
- Limit the explanation to 500 words or less
- Review and follow all [guidelines](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/exercise-guidelines)

## Example

An example Boyd explanation will be posted [here](/course-ntw2029/hidden/exercise-examples/e03-eg) after the exercise 3 deadline.
