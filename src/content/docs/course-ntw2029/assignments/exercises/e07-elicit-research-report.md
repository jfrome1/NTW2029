### Overview

You will create an Elicit.com account, generate a research report based on an assigned question, and share the report with the class so everyone can use the reports to find a source for Paper 2.

## Details

While this assignment is optional (completing it gives full credit, but skipping it has no grade penalty), your classmates may benefit from your report. 'm hoping you can do it ASAP, and I'll post em below as they come in.

No GenAI link or non-use statement is needed for this assignment.

## Instructions

- All reports will be shared with the class, giving everyone access to a variety of potential sources
- This report can help identify potential sources for Paper 2, but you're not required to use any sources from it
- The research questions were randomly assigned to students; if everyone submits, it won't matter who ran which report

## Checklist
