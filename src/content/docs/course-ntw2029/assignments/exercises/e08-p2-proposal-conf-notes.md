title: Exercise 8 - Paper 2 post-conference notes (proposal conference)
date: 2024-10-12

---

The purpose of this assignment is to help you consolidate your thoughts about the proposal feedback so you can better plan your draft.

After our conference, consider our discussion and my feedback on your draft.

Copy and paste the following questions into the Exercise 8 text box on Canvas. Don't delete the questions--keep them and type answers below each question:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your proposal?
2. What other points of feedback were discussed?
3. What are your planned next steps for drafting your introduction and paper outline?
4. Are there any next steps that you don't currently know how to make progress on? What will you do to figure them out?
5. (optional) Do you any other comments or feedback for me?

Please review and follow all [exercise guidelines](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/exercise-guidelines).
