The purpose of this exercise is twofold. First, it will allow you to reflect on your class participation in this course. Second, it will help me better understand how Singapore students think about class participation.

Please write a paragraph of at least 100 words describing and evaluating your class participation in the class, as well as stating what grade you think you have earned. I won't use the grade you give yourself to determine your grade; that is mostly to get a better sense of student views and expectations.

Aspects of class participation you might consider are:

1. asking or answer questions during group discussion
2. communication outside of class (office hours, email, chat)
3. preparation for class meetings (readings, notes, website)
4. contribution in small-group exercises

Please review and follow all [exercise guidelines](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/exercise-guidelines).
