title: Exercise 10 - P06 Conference Notes
---

## Purpose

This exercise helps you consolidate feedback from our conference and create an action plan for revising your P06 explanation. By articulating the key points from our discussion, you'll better internalize the feedback and develop a clear strategy for completing your explanation work before moving to analysis in P07.

## Overview

Answer the following questions about the conference feedback and your revision plans. These questions focus on P06's core challenge: explaining positions accurately and neutrally without slipping into premature analysis or evaluation.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the following questions into the Exercise 10 text box on Canvas. Don't delete the questions—keep them and type answers below each question:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your P06 explanation?

2. Did you maintain neutral explanation throughout, or did feedback identify places where you slipped into analysis or evaluation? If so, what specific language or moves did you need to revise?

3. Were your explanations of the target article's position and the commentary's position complete enough for a reader to understand the criticism? What gaps (if any) need to be filled?

4. Did you allocate space effectively—focusing on where the heart of the criticism is located rather than equal coverage? What adjustments (if any) do you need to make?

5. As you explained both positions, did you identify any gaps in your understanding that will require additional sources for P07? What information do you still need?

6. What are your planned next steps for revising your P06 explanation before moving to analysis in P07?

7. (Optional) Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for me?

## Guidelines

- Be specific when describing feedback points—reference particular sections or requirements in your explanation
- For neutrality issues (question 2), note the specific language that signaled evaluation rather than explanation (e.g., "correctly argues," "unfortunately overlooks," "makes the stronger case")
- For completeness issues (question 3), identify which position (target or commentary) needs more development and what specific information is missing
- For space allocation (question 4), consider whether you spent too much time on context and not enough on the criticism itself, or vice versa
- For source gaps (question 5), think practically about what information would help you analyze this disagreement in P07—don't just list general topics
- Remember that P06 forbids analytical thesis, evaluation of positions, taking sides, or claims about what underlies their disagreement—these moves all belong in P07 and later assignments

### After the Conference

After this conference, you can ask specific questions about particular parts of the paper via email or messaging as time allows, or schedule additional meetings during the week.

Note: I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts or respond to general questions such as "is this ok?"

### The Path Forward

Once you've revised P06 to provide complete, neutral explanation of both positions, you'll move to P07 where you'll finally develop your analytical thesis about what underlies their disagreement. Your P06 explanation is the foundation that makes P07's analysis possible.

## Feedback

You'll receive completion credit for thoughtful responses. This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your revision process.
