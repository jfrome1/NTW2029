title: Exercise 10 - P06 Conference Notes
---

## Purpose

This exercise helps you consolidate feedback from our conference and create an action plan for revising your P06 explanation. P06's core challenge is explaining positions accurately and neutrally—describing what each side says without analyzing what's really going on beneath the surface disagreement. That analytical work belongs in P07.

By articulating the key points from our discussion, you'll better internalize the feedback and develop a clear strategy for completing your explanation work before moving to analysis in P07.

## Why This Is Challenging

Many students struggle with P06 because they've already formed conclusions about the disagreement and find it difficult to describe positions without revealing their analysis. Watch for these patterns:

- Using interpretive language ("reveals," "shows," "demonstrates") instead of neutral attribution ("argues," "claims," "states")
- Explaining why positions differ (analytical move) instead of just showing that they differ (descriptive move)
- Evaluating which position is stronger or more complete
- Focusing on what you think underlies the disagreement rather than what each side explicitly says

If you caught yourself doing any of these in your draft, that's valuable self-awareness for P07.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the questions below into a document and type your answer below each question, in full sentences. Keep the question numbered:

1. **Do you understand the assignment's key constraint?** In one sentence, explain the difference between P06's work (what they say) and P07's work (what's really going on). Then provide a concrete example from your own draft showing where you slipped into P07-type analysis when you should have stayed in P06-type description.

2. **What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your P06 explanation?** Be specific—reference particular sections or requirements in your explanation.

3. **Did you maintain neutral explanation throughout?** Quote the specific phrases from your draft that signaled interpretation or evaluation rather than description. What language patterns should you watch for when revising?

4. **Were your explanations complete enough?** Identify which position (target or commentary) needs more development and what specific information is a reader missing to understand the criticism.

5. **Did you allocate space effectively?** Did you focus on where the heart of the criticism is located rather than equal coverage? What adjustments do you need to make?

6. **What confusion or uncertainty remains?** Don't just list topics you need to research. Include conceptual confusion or persistent uncertainty—this is expected and valuable for P07. If the disagreement seems circular or you hit what feels like a "dead end," that's not failure—that's discovering the complexity you'll analyze in P07. What specifically puzzles you about your P06 description before moving to P07's interpretation work?

7. **What are your planned next steps for revising P06?** Be specific about what sections need work and what you'll change.

8. **(Optional)** Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for me?

## Guidelines

**For question 1 (understanding the constraint)**:
- The distinction is between describing what positions say vs. analyzing what underlies them
- Your concrete example should show exactly where you moved from description to interpretation
- This is diagnostic—not a grade, just helping you recognize the pattern

**For question 3 (neutrality)**:
- Quote the specific phrases that signal interpretation rather than description
- Note the difference between "The target article claims X because Y" (neutral description) and "The target article reveals X" or "What's really happening is Y" (interpretation)

**For question 4 (completeness)**:
- Identify which position (target or commentary) needs more development
- What specific information is a reader missing to understand the criticism?

**For question 6 (confusion)**:
- Don't just list topics you need to research
- Include conceptual confusion or persistent uncertainty—this is expected and valuable for P07
- If the disagreement seems circular or you hit what feels like a "dead end," that's not failure—that's discovering the complexity you'll analyze in P07

**Remember**: P06 forbids analytical thesis, interpretation of what's at stake, evaluation of positions, taking sides, or claims about what underlies their disagreement. Those moves all belong in P07. If you're tempted to say "what's really going on is..." or "the underlying issue is...," stop—that's P07 work.

## After the Conference

After this conference, you can ask specific questions about particular parts of the paper via email or messaging as time allows, or schedule additional meetings during the week.

Note: I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts or respond to general questions such as "is this ok?"

## The Path Forward

Once you've revised P06 to provide complete, neutral description of what each side says, you'll move to P07 where you'll finally interpret what's really going on beneath the surface disagreement. Your P06 description is the foundation that makes P07's interpretation possible—you can't analyze what you haven't accurately described.

## Feedback

You'll receive completion credit for thoughtful responses. This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your revision process.
