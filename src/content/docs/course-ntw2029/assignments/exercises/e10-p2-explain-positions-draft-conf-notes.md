## Purpose

This exercise helps you consolidate feedback from our conference and create an action plan for revising your draft. By articulating the key points from our discussion, you'll better internalize the feedback and develop a clear revision strategy.

## Overview

Answer the following questions about the conference feedback and your revision plans.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the following questions into the Exercise 9 text box on Canvas. Don't delete the questions—keep them and type answers below each question:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your draft?
2. What other points of feedback were discussed?
3. What are your planned next steps for revising your draft?
4. Are there any next steps that you don't currently know how to make progress on? Do you have questions about them or do you know what to do?
5. (optional) Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for me?

## Guidelines

- Be specific when describing feedback points—reference particular sections or arguments in your analysis
- For revision plans, prioritize changes that strengthen your central argument
- Consider how feedback on your art analysis connects to your EP framework
- If you're uncertain about how to implement feedback, use question 4 to clarify
- After this conference, you can ask specific questions about particular parts of the paper via email or messaging as time allows, or schedule additional meetings during the week
- Note: I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts or respond to general questions such as "is this ok?"

## Feedback

You'll receive completion credit for thoughtful responses. This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your revision process.

The purpose of this assignment is to help you consolidate your thoughts about the draft feedback so you can better plan your revisions.

After our conference, consider our discussion and my feedback on your draft.

Copy and paste the following questions into the Exercise 9 text box on Canvas. Don't delete the questions--keep them and type answers below each question:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your draft?
2. What other points of feedback were discussed?
3. What are your planned next steps for revising your draft?
4. Are there any next steps that you don't currently know how to make progress on? Do you have questions about them or do you know what to do?
5. (optional) Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for me?

Please review and follow all [exercise guidelines](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/exercise-guidelines).

After this conference, if you have any specific questions about particular parts of the paper, just ask. I'm happy to respond to questions over email or messaging as time allows, or to schedule additional meetings during the week.

Unfortunately, I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts or respond to general questions such as emailing me a draft paragraph and asking "is this ok?".
