title: Exercise 10 - P06 Conference Notes
---

## Purpose

This exercise helps you consolidate guidance from our conference about analyzing scholarly disagreements. The conference focused on teaching analytical frameworks and research strategies for P2 work, building on your P06 position explanation.

By articulating what you learned in the conference, you'll better internalize the analytical approaches and develop a clear strategy for your P2 research and writing.

## Why This Is Challenging

Conferences cover multiple layers of guidance—terminology clarifications, analytical frameworks, research strategies, and thinking processes. It's easy to lose track of key insights without deliberately consolidating them.

This exercise asks you to capture what teaching you received so you can reference it throughout P2 work.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the questions below into a document and type your answer below each question, in full sentences. Keep the question numbered:

1. **What were the 2 or 3 most important points of feedback from the conference?** Be specific about what you learned or what changed in your understanding.

2. **Did the instructor teach any specific approach or framework for analyzing the disagreement?** If so, describe the approach and explain how it applies to your disagreement. If not, write "No specific approach discussed."

3. **Did the instructor clarify any key terms or concepts that you were unclear about?** If so, which terms and how does understanding them change your analysis? If not, write "No terminology clarifications."

4. **Did the instructor distinguish between surface-level and underlying disagreements in your case?** If so, what's the surface disagreement and what might be underlying it? If not, write "This distinction wasn't discussed."

5. **Did the instructor suggest any research strategies or specific sources for P2?** If so, what should you investigate and where? If not, write "No research strategies discussed."

6. **Did the instructor provide guidance about the thinking process itself—how to approach academic analysis?** If so, what was that meta-cognitive guidance? If not, write "No process guidance discussed."

7. **How did the conference change what you think the disagreement is actually about?** Did your understanding of what's at stake shift? Be specific about what changed.

8. **What confusion or uncertainty remains?** Include conceptual confusion or persistent puzzlement. If the disagreement seems circular or you hit what feels like a "dead end," that's not failure—that's discovering complexity you'll analyze in P2. What specifically puzzles you?

9. **(Optional)** Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for me?

## Guidelines

**For question 1 (most important points)**:
- Don't just list topics discussed
- Focus on insights that changed your understanding or approach
- Be specific about what you learned

**For question 2 (analytical approach)**:
- Examples might include: hierarchical analysis (claim → characterization → underlying truth), thought experiments (if surface issue resolved, would criticism remain?), evidence-first vs conclusion-first approaches
- Explain how the approach applies to your specific disagreement

**For question 3 (terminology)**:
- Include both simple clarifications and more complex conceptual distinctions
- Explain how the clarification affects your analysis

**For question 4 (surface vs underlying)**:
- Surface disagreement = what they explicitly say they disagree about
- Underlying disagreement = what really drives the criticism, what theoretical commitments differ
- These may be different—that's valuable to recognize

**For question 5 (research strategies)**:
- Include specific article searches, author investigations, related literature, academic search tools
- Note if instructor suggested checking authors' other work or finding related debates

**For question 6 (thinking process)**:
- Examples might include: "analysis before evaluation," "describe disagreement structure rather than pick sides," "truth-seeking not debating," "understanding before judging"
- This is about HOW to think, not WHAT to think

**For question 7 (understanding shift)**:
- Did you discover the disagreement is about something different than you initially thought?
- Did reframing work reveal a new dimension?
- Be honest if nothing changed—that's valid too

**For question 8 (confusion)**:
- Don't just list topics you need to research
- Include conceptual puzzlement, seeming contradictions, dead ends that need untangling
- This confusion is expected and valuable—it shows you're engaging with complexity

## After the Conference

After this conference, you can ask specific questions about particular parts of P2 via email or messaging as time allows, or schedule additional meetings during the week.

Note: I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts or respond to general questions such as "is this ok?"

## The Path Forward

Use the analytical frameworks and research strategies from the conference as you move into P2 work. Your P06 position explanation provides the foundation, and the conference taught you how to analyze what's really going on beneath those positions.

## Feedback

You'll receive completion credit for thoughtful responses. This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your analytical development.
