## Purpose

This exercise helps you consolidate guidance from our conference about analyzing scholarly disagreements. By articulating what you learned in the conference, you'll better internalize the analytical approaches and develop a clear strategy for your P2 research and writing.

## Overview

To capture the key insights and guidance from the conference, answer the following questions about the conference and your future plans for Paper 2.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the questions below into a document and type your answer below each question, in full sentences. Keep the question numbered:

1. **What were the 2 or 3 most important points of feedback from the conference?** Be specific about what you learned or what changed in your understanding.

2. **What did I recommend as the most important next step for your writing?** If there was no one specific activity mentioned, describe one important step either recommended or planned.

3. **Did we discuss any specific approach or framework for analyzing the disagreement?** If so, describe the approach and explain how it applies to your disagreement. If not, write "No specific approach discussed."

4. **Did we clarify any key terms or concepts that you were unclear about?** If so, which terms and how does understanding them change your analysis? If not, write "No terminology clarifications."

5. **Did we discuss the difference between surface-level and underlying disagreements in your case?** If so, what's the surface disagreement and what might be underlying it? If not, write "This distinction wasn't discussed."

6. **Did I suggest any research strategies or specific sources for P2?** If so, what should you investigate and where? If not, write "No research strategies discussed."

7. **What questions were raised about the target and commentary article's claims that you plan to clarify or research further?** If none, write "No questions raised."

8. **(Optional)** Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for me?

## Guidelines

- Be specific in your answers
- Since it's hard to remember everything discussed in the conference, I encourage you to review the conference transcript while answering these questions

### Getting help

- Don't ask me questions in this assignment; if you want me to answer, email or message me separately
- After this conference, I encourage questions about your revision process. See [what kinds of questions I can answer](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences#post-conference-support) and [why I can't review emailed draft sections](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences#why-cant-you-review-emailed-drafts).

## Feedback

This exercise won't receive individual comments but will inform my understanding of your writing development process.
