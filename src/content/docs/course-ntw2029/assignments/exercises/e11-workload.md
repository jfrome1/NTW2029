Instructors are told that this course should require an average of 10 hours of work per week, and I want to make sure I am within that guideline. I need your help to make sure I'm meeting this goal.

For this assignment, keep a record of the amount of time you spend on this class and [submit an workload report](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/73753/assignments/152150) as indicated on the schedule.

Please download a blank [workload report](/downloads/2420-NTW2029workload.docx), save it, and log your time in hours, using numbers only (use "2" not "2 h"), rounding to the nearest half hour (0.5).

It is fine if your data is not accurate; just make your best estimates.

Include both writing assignments and "preparation", which includes everything else you do for the course outside of class.

For writing assignments, when you estimate time, _include_ time spent reading Canvas, reading sources, getting feedback on assignments from people, etc. and report the total time.

:::note
The amount of time you spend on this course will not affect your grade in any way, including your participation grade. I am just collecting data.
:::

Record your time every week, and submit the report monthly as indicated on the schedule. For this exercise, just upload a file attachment. You don't need to put anything in the text box.

When you submit your report, please submit it in the original `.docx` format, not as a `.doc`, `.pdf` or other file type. If you open the report in Pages, make sure to Export the file to `.docx`, as I can't read files saved in the default format in Pages.
