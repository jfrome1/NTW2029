## Purpose

This exercise continues developing your ability to identify and evaluate competing explanations in academic conversations. You'll practice recognizing how new theories build on or challenge existing ones, and begin identifying potential weaknesses in argumentsâ€”a skill essential for Paper 2.

## Overview

You will answer questions about Savage et al.'s article on music's evolutionary origins and one critical commentary. The target article addresses why music exists universally across human cultures despite having no obvious survival benefit.

## Requirements

### Reading

Read (at least) the following parts of "Music as a coevolved system for social bonding" (Savage et al., 2021):

- Abstract (in full)
- Section 1, "The biological puzzle of music" (in full)
- Section 2, "Is music an adaptation?" (skip subsections 2.1-2.6, read only the intro paragraph and concluding paragraph starting with "In sum...")
- Section 3, "The social bonding hypothesis" (intro paragraph plus ONE subsection of your choice from 3.1-3.4)
- Section 4, "Predictions of the social bonding hypothesis" (first paragraph only)
- Section 5, "Conclusion" (in full)

Also read the commentary "Music as a non-adaptionist phenomenon" (Killin, 2021) on pp. 98-99.

### Questions

Copy and paste the following questions into a document and type answers below each question, in full sentences. Include page numbers for any quotations or specific references.

1. **The phenomenon**: What puzzle about music's universality do Savage et al. identify? Why is this puzzling from an evolutionary perspective?

2. **Existing theories**: The authors review several previous theories. Choose TWO from the following: sexual selection, parent-infant interaction, coalition signaling, or skill development. For each:
   - Briefly explain what it claims
   - Identify one weakness the authors find with it

3. **The new proposal**: Explain the social bonding hypothesis in your own words. What are its TWO main components (hint: see abstract)? How is it different from just saying "music helps people bond"?

4. **Identifying critique**: Quote one specific criticism Killin makes about the target article's argument. After the quote, explain in your own words what assumption or claim Killin is challenging.

5. **Finding gaps**: Based on your reading, identify one question the authors don't address or one assumption they don't justify. Use this template: "The authors claim [X] because [Y], but they don't explain why [Y is true/Z doesn't matter instead]."

## Guidelines

- For question 2, focus on the authors' evaluation of theories, not detailed explanation of each theory
- For question 3, distinguish between the general claim and the specific mechanisms proposed
- For question 5, think about:
  - Untested assumptions (what do they take for granted?)
  - Missing evidence (what would you need to know to believe their claim?)
  - Alternative explanations not considered
  - Definitional issues (are key terms clear?)

## Feedback

This exercise will receive completion credit only. We'll discuss your answers in class 9.1, where we'll practice identifying argumentative weaknesses in preparation for Paper 2.
