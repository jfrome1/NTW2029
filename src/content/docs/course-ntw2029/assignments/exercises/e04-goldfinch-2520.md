## Purpose

This assignment continues your practice in explaining complex texts, now with academic writing aimed at specialists. While Boyd wrote for a general audience, Goldfinch writes for academics, so the challenge is understanding his argument well enough to translate it for readers unfamiliar with evolutionary psychology's methodological debates.

## Overview

You'll explain section 2.7.4 of Goldfinch's critique of evolutionary psychology in under 300 words. Your explanation should help a general reader understand his arguments without needing specialized knowledge of EP methodology.

## Instructions

Explain section 2.7.4 from Goldfinch, Andrew. _Rethinking Evolutionary Psychology_. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015. Keep your explanation under 500 words with no introduction or conclusion. Citations aren't necessary for this exercise, but properly attribute ideas in your text.

## Guidelines

### Target Audience

Your goal is to explain the main points of Goldfinch's section for a general reader. Your audience has no specialized knowledge of evolutionary psychology methodology but can follow logical arguments when clearly presented.

### Approach

Shorten the text by leaving out details not necessary for the reader to understand the overall argument. Expand the text to explicate ideas, assumptions, and other elements that are crucial to the argument but are not clearly explained by Goldfinch in a way your audience would understand.

This reading comes from a book by an academic publisher, written for other academics who are at least somewhat familiar with the topic. You may find the text challenging.

### Structure Considerations

Don't assume that you should explain each paragraph and present the information in the same order as the original. Think about what is and isn't needed to explain these pages to your reader so they understand Goldfinch's main points. The original may spend a lot of time on details that aren't needed for your reader to understand the big picture.

### Attribution

Remember to properly attribute all ideas to their source rather than writing them as if they are your original ideas. In this case, it is harder, because Goldfinch is explaining what other people have said. Thus, don't write, "Claims about adaptive traits..." or "Richardson argues that claims about adaptive traits..." but "According to Goldfinch, Richardson argues that claims about adaptive traits...". It's hard to do this gracefully, so don't worry about it too much for this exercise.

## Feedback

For this exercise, after the submission deadline, I'll post an example explanation on this page for you to compare to your submission. I'll also make brief individualized comments with suggestions for writing improvement. You are welcome to ask for additional feedback either in an in-person meeting or via email/messaging.

## Example Explanations

Example Goldfinch explanations of 2.7.1 to 2.7.3 will be posted [here](/course-ntw2029/hidden/exercise-examples/e04-eg-1-3) after class 3.1.

An example explanation of 2.7.4 will be posted here after the exercise 4 deadline.
