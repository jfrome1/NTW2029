<!-- I've introduced myself to you on the "Meet your instructor" page. Now it's your turn! Please introduce yourself to me and the class in a post on the "Discussions" page in the thread "Exercise 1 - introductions".
 -->

I know we did quick introductions in our first class, but I'd like everyone to get to know each other better by asking you to introduce yourself in a post. It's a small class and works much better when we are comfortable talking in the group. Having this written down also helps me remember everyone's details when I'm planning lessons or giving feedback.

In your post, I'd love to know:

**About You**

- Your name and what you'd like me to call you in class (please don't say "anything is fine" - just tell me what you actually prefer!)
- Where you grew up if it wasn't Singapore, or any interesting experience living in other countries
- Your major and, if you have one, what specifically interests you within that field
- The last academic writing project you did, either before NUS or in NUS (could be GP, IB Extended Essay, or just a major assignment) and the topic and/or goal. If it was GP, let me know which question you wrote on, if you remember.

**Your Background with Evolution and Art**

- What kinds of art or media entertainment do you genuinely enjoy? (I promise I'm not a snob - I watch both low-end horror films and arthouse films, so just be honest)
- How much do you already know about evolution, if anything? In what contexts have you learned about evolution? School, church, self-study, online?
- Any background in studying or creating art/media?

**You and Writing**

- How do you honestly feel about writing - love it, hate it, somewhere in between? And why? (be as honest as you want here - it only helps me figure out how to teach you better)
- What things did you like or dislike about your previous writing instruction? (the instruction doesn't have to be from a writing class; maybe it was just going over an assignment in a science or history class)

If there's anything in these topics you'd rather tell me privately instead of posting publicly, just send me an email.
