title: Exercise 10 - Paper 2 writing reflection
date: 2024-08-13

---

The purpose of this exercise is to encourage you to critically reflect on how you approached Paper 2 and what you learned from the writing process.

Please answer the following questions. Don't try to use your answers to present a curated image of yourself as a writer; these answers will not affect your paper grade, and you will benefit most from honest reflection. Answers can be as long or short as needed (no word count requirements).

Copy and paste the following questions into the Exercise 10 text box on Canvas. Don't delete the questions--keep them and type answers below each question:

1. What parts of your paper are you most proud of and why?
2. What parts of the paper do you think still need improvement and why?
3. What major changes did you make on your draft after our conference?
4. Did you use the feedback form? If yes, how did you do so and how helpful was it?
5. Did you use ChatGPT? If yes, how did you do so and how helpful was it?
6. Did you consult others for feedback? If yes, how did you do so and how helpful was it?
7. Was there any specific aspect of writing (e.g. topic sentences, illustrative examples, unclear referents) that you found particularly challenging to deal with?
8. In general, what was the biggest challenge in writing this paper?
9. What did you learn from writing this paper that you will apply to future writing assignments?
10. Do you have any suggestions for improving the Paper 1 process for next time I teach the course?

And the most important question:

11. What were the most significant things you will take from this course?
