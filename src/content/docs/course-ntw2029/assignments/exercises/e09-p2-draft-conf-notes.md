title: Exercise 9 - Paper 2 post-conference notes (draft conference)
date: 2024-10-12

---

The purpose of this assignment is to help you consolidate your thoughts about the draft feedback so you can better plan your revisions.

After our conference, consider our discussion and my feedback on your draft.

Copy and paste the following questions into the Exercise 9 text box on Canvas. Don't delete the questions--keep them and type answers below each question:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your draft?
2. What other points of feedback were discussed?
3. What are your planned next steps for revising your draft?
4. Are there any next steps that you don't currently know how to make progress on? Do you have questions about them or do you know what to do?
5. (optional) Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for me?

Please review and follow all [exercise guidelines](/course-ntw2029/assignments/general/exercise-guidelines).

After this conference, if you have any specific questions about particular parts of the paper, just ask. I'm happy to respond to questions over email or messaging as time allows, or to schedule additional meetings during the week.

Unfortunately, I cannot comment on emailed sections of papers or drafts or respond to general questions such as emailing me a draft paragraph and asking "is this ok?".
