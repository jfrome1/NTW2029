# Exercise 8 - Paper 2 Proposal Conference Summary

## Purpose
This exercise helps you consolidate feedback from our Paper 2 proposal conference and refine your approach before drafting. By articulating the key points from our discussion about your topic and sources, you'll develop a clearer vision for your analytical paper.

## Overview
You'll answer five questions about the conference feedback and your plans for developing the paper. Submit your responses directly in the Canvas text box on the day of your conference.

## Requirements
Copy and paste the following questions into the Exercise 8 text box on Canvas. Don't delete the questionsâ€”keep them and type answers below each question:

1. What were the two or three most important points of feedback on your proposal?
2. What other points of feedback were discussed?
3. What are your planned next steps for developing your paper?
4. Are there any next steps that you don't currently know how to make progress on? Do you have questions about them or do you know what to do?
5. (optional) Do you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for me?

## Guidelines
- Be specific when describing feedback about your chosen artwork and EP theories
- For development plans, focus on how you'll strengthen the connection between your EP framework and art analysis
- Consider feedback about source selection and how to incorporate academic conversation
- If you're uncertain about narrowing your focus or developing your argument, use question 4 to clarify
- After this conference, you can ask specific questions via email or messaging as time allows, or schedule additional meetings during the week

## Feedback
You'll receive completion credit for thoughtful responses. This exercise won't receive individual comments but will help guide my feedback on your draft.
