## Understanding Evolution and EP

### What's the difference between adaptation and evolution?

Let me answer with an analogy from class. Evolution is the broader process of species changing over time, while adaptation is a specific trait that evolved because it helped survival or reproduction. You can have evolution without adaptation (like genetic drift), and not everything that changes is an adaptation.

### What is the EEA (Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness)?

The EEA refers to the ancestral environment where humans evolved their current traits, roughly 10,000-200,000 years ago. The key insight is that we're adapted to that environment, not our current one, which helps explain many behaviors that seem puzzling today. Check the Evolution Resources page for more detailed explanations.

### Why do humans have behaviors that seem irrational today?

Good question! Actually, the idea is that we evolved traits for the EEA, but our environment changed so much, so quickly, that we didn't have a chance to evolve traits that maximize our fitness in our current environment. For example, overeating made sense when food was scarce, but now leads to obesity. Celebrity obsession may be our evolved tendency to pay attention to high-status individuals, which made sense in small groups but gets "hijacked" in modern media environments.

### What is Niche Construction Theory (NCT)?

Niche Construction Theory is not a behavior or an aspect of an organism - it's a theory (a way of looking at the world) that encourages us to notice that many aspects of the environment are shaped by organisms' behaviors. Think of beavers building dams, which then create new environments and selection pressures. Please check the NCT resources on the website for short, helpful readings on this topic!

### Does NCT mean humans stopped evolving?

You got it! We changed our environment so quickly that biological evolution couldn't keep up. Cultural evolution has largely replaced biological evolution for humans - we solve problems with technology and social changes rather than waiting for genetic changes. This is why we're "mismatched" to modern life.

### How does ecological inheritance work?

Ecological inheritance means inheriting the environment, including ways it was changed by parents and ancestors. This definitely includes things like surrounding plants, structures (hives or dams), and other results of behaviors. I think there are many things that are neither entirely genetic nor "taught" to offspring, such as baby beavers being born in a dam that their ancestors built.

## Understanding Art Through EP

### How does EP explain why humans make art?

We'll explore multiple theories in this course. Pinker argues that art hijacks pleasure systems evolved for other purposes (like our preference for certain landscapes that resembled good habitats). Others argue art serves adaptive functions like social bonding, mate selection, or practicing important skills through fiction. We'll examine the evidence for each view.

### What counts as "art" from an EP perspective?

It's not always clear what counts as art, but for EP purposes, we often focus on universally enjoyed art forms rather than art that requires extensive cultural education to appreciate. Calendar landscapes, pop music, and Hollywood movies might reveal more about evolved preferences than avant-garde works. As Pinker notes, studying popular art helps us understand human psychology.

### What's kitsch, and why does it matter?

Kitsch is a type of popular art that is particularly looked down upon by cultural elites - think paintings on black velvet or garden gnomes. Pinker believes that studying art from an evolutionary perspective requires looking at the most popular forms of art rather than art that is considered most praiseworthy by cultural elites. Not all popular art is kitsch though - nice landscape calendars are popular but not necessarily lowbrow.

### How do optical illusions relate to EP?

Our brains didn't evolve to handle 2D representations or impossible figures. Optical illusions exploit perceptual systems that work fine in nature but fail with artificial stimuli. It's interesting to learn that we hadn't evolved to process optical illusions as the brain hadn't evolved to distinguish fiction from reality - this ability wasn't an adaptation in the EEA.

### What are hyperstimuli?

These are artificial stimuli that trigger responses more strongly than natural versions. Think about how candy is sweeter than any fruit found in nature, or how anime characters have impossibly large eyes. These "hack" our evolved preferences by exaggerating the features we're programmed to notice.

### Why can't knowledge override illusions?

Different brain systems are at work here. Your evolved perceptual system operates automatically and can't be overridden by conscious knowledge. Even with the knowledge that what we're seeing is an illusion, we're unable to use this knowledge to change what we see.

## EP Arguments and Theories

### What's the difference between natural and sexual selection?

Natural selection favors traits that help survival (like camouflage or disease resistance). Sexual selection favors traits that help mating success, even if they hurt survival - think of the peacock's tail, which attracts mates but also makes the bird more visible to predators.

### Why do humans find certain landscapes beautiful?

We evolved preferences for environments that offered good survival prospects. Rolling hills with water and scattered trees resemble the African savanna where humans evolved. These scenes trigger positive emotions because our ancestors who liked them survived better. The calendar example from class shows how these preferences are universal.

### Is enjoying art "irrational" from an evolutionary view?

This depends on which theory you accept! If art is a byproduct (Pinker's view), then yes - in some sense we're "wasting" time and resources. But if art serves adaptive functions like social bonding or skill practice (Boyd's view), then it's fulfilling evolved purposes. We'll explore both perspectives.

### Why does fiction feel real when we know it's fake?

Great observation! Our brains didn't evolve to distinguish fiction from reality because fiction didn't exist in the EEA. Our emotional systems respond to stories as if they're real events, which is why we cry at sad movies or feel scared during horror films.

## Clarifying Common Confusions

### Does evolution mean we can't control our behaviors?

Not at all! We're able to override many instinctive behaviors. For example, you may meet someone rude that you want to punch, but you resist because of modern rules or consequences. Our evolved preferences don't always drive our actual behavior, but that doesn't mean we don't have evolved preferences that can influence our behavior.

### Is everything about humans explained by evolution?

No - culture, individual learning, and random factors all matter too. Evolution provides the basic architecture and tendencies, but doesn't determine everything we do. Also, if you think about the population as a whole, we see patterns even though individuals vary.

### Does "adaptive" mean "good" or "useful now"?

Be careful here! Adaptive means it helped reproduction in ancestral environments. Many adaptive traits cause problems now (anxiety, sweet cravings). Don't commit the naturalistic fallacy - natural doesn't mean good or desirable in modern contexts.

### Are humans still evolving?

Truthfully, humans have altered our environment so much in such a short time (evolutionarily speaking) that it doesn't really make sense to think about human evolution over the last 5,000 years as explainable by the theory of evolution. Note that modern markers of fitness, such as access to resources and beauty, no longer seem to correlate with the number of offspring people have. You can learn more on the Evolution Resources page at "Are humans still evolving?"

### What if I'm struggling with the biological concepts?

You will be okay! Just ask me if you have questions. If you're confused about something, others probably are too, and I'm happy to explain concepts in different ways until they make sense.

### Should I assume the EEA concept is true for my papers?

The concept of EEA may be controversial among critics of EP, but it isn't among EP proponents. Thus, we will use it to discuss EP, but should be aware of its potential limitations. Although I have some reservations about many types of EP research, I don't think that the concept of an EEA is something that can be dismissed - it's a coherent concept that can be useful in discussing human evolution.

## Evolution and Religion

### Are evolution and religion incompatible?

Not necessarily! Many people believe in both God and evolution. Some see evolution as the mechanism God used to create the diversity of life, just as they accept gravity as a mechanism God created for planetary motion. The disagreement occurs between those who read the Bible literally versus metaphorically. Full discussion on the [Evolution and Religion page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/ev-religion).

### How can I tell if someone rejects evolution?

The best indicator isn't whether someone believes in God - it's their stance on the age of the Earth. Young Earth creationists believe it's less than 10,000 years old based on Biblical genealogies. Scientists say it's about 4.5 billion years old based on multiple forms of evidence. If you accept an old Earth, evolution and religion are fairly compatible.

### What if I believe in a young Earth?

There are serious conflicts to resolve since evolution requires millions of years. Some argue the science is wrong, others that evidence was created to appear old, or that evolution happens much faster than scientists think. The [Evolution and Religion page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/ev-religion) discusses these positions in detail.

## Common Evolution Questions

### Isn't evolution "just a theory"?

Science uses "theory" differently than everyday language. We have the "germ theory of disease" but no one says "aren't germs just a theory?" In science, a theory is a well-substantiated explanation supported by evidence - like the theory of gravity. See more on the [Questioning Evolution page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/questioning-evolution).

### Has evolution ever been observed?

Yes! We've observed evolution in our lifetimes, including new species arising. The longest-running evolution experiment has tracked bacterial evolution for decades. Links to examples on the [Questioning Evolution page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/questioning-evolution).

### If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?

We didn't evolve FROM modern monkeys - we share a common ancestor WITH them. It's like asking "if you descended from your grandparents, why do you still have cousins?" Different branches evolved in different directions.

### Are humans still evolving?

Biologically, very slowly and unpredictably. Cultural evolution has largely replaced biological evolution for humans - we solve problems with technology and social changes rather than waiting for genetic changes. More on the [Questioning Evolution page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/questioning-evolution).

## Nature vs. Nurture

### Are traits determined by genes or environment?

Most traits result from both! Very few traits are determined by genes alone (like earlobes or blood type). Most bodily and behavioral traits come from the interaction of many genes and environment. Height is mostly genetic but also affected by nutrition. Even vision requires environmental input - animals raised in darkness become blind. Details on the [Nature vs. Nurture page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/nature-vs-nurture).

### How should I think about nature vs. nurture?

Think "environmental variation within genetic range." Genetics sets the parameters (range of possible outcomes), while environment determines how traits actually develop within those parameters. A tree might have genes to grow 10 meters tall, but poor soil keeps it at 5 meters. Good soil won't make it 500 meters tall though!

### What are innate traits?

Innate doesn't mean present at birth or existing in every member without exception. Innate means developing in members of a species under normal circumstances - like color vision, walking ability, or male facial hair after puberty. See the [Traits page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/traits).

## Cooperation and Altruism

### Why do organisms cooperate if evolution is about competition?

Cooperation can increase survival! The Prisoner's Dilemma shows how cooperation strategies can evolve even when cheating seems advantageous. We cooperate with kin who share our genes, and with non-kin when reciprocal benefits exist. Videos and explanations on the [Cooperation page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/cooperation).

### Can you explain the part about kin selection in bees in [Are Genes Really Selfish? - Instant Egghead #57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZlOjVtnRx4&t=119s)?

That part in the video is confusing because it doesn't really explain the part about "a strange fact about honey bee genetics..."  the queen and the female drones have two sets of bars while the male drones have only one set of bars? The bars are their genes--female bees have 2x the number of genes as male bees. Because male and female be have different amounts of genes, female bees share on average 75% of their genes with their sisters, but would share only 50% of genes on average with their own children, if they had children. This difference is supposed to explain why female bees evolved do not have their own children, but instead help the queen reproduce have children. The female bees "altruistically "don't spend time creating children or raising them, instead helping the Queen create and raise children (their "sisters"). The video suggests that this behavior evolved because it, on average, produces more copies of the female bees' genes.

### What's the free-rider problem?

In groups, individuals can benefit from cooperation without contributing (free-riding). Evolution has produced mechanisms to detect and punish cheaters - like our strong emotional reactions to unfairness. See the monkey fairness experiment on the [Cooperation page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/cooperation).

## Understanding Genetics

### What's the difference between DNA, genes, and chromosomes?

DNA is the molecule containing genetic information. Genes are sections of DNA that code for specific traits. Chromosomes are structures containing many genes bundled together. Think of it like: DNA is the paper, genes are sentences, and chromosomes are chapters. Links to video explanations on the [Genetics Terminology page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/genetics-terminology).

### What's the difference between genotype and phenotype?

Genotype is your genetic blueprint (your DNA). Phenotype is what actually shows up - your observable traits. The same genotype can produce different phenotypes in different environments. Details on the [Traits page](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/traits).
