## Communication

### How should I contact you?

Use email for formal requests like extensions or grade concerns - just include "NTW2029" in the subject line so your email goes to the right folder. For quick questions, use our Telegram class chat. You can also grab me after class for brief questions. Full details on the [Communication & Support page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/communication-support).

### What if you don't respond to my email?

Please email me again if you don't hear back within one business day. Sometimes emails without "NTW2029" in the subject get lost among administrative emails.

### Can I message you on Canvas?

I don't check Canvas messages or office voicemail, so please use email or Telegram instead.

## Policies and Deadlines

### Can I submit assignments late?

Yes! You can submit any assignment (except peer review) up to 12 hours late automatically - just submit by noon the next day without emailing me. This includes final papers. For extensions beyond 12 hours, we'd need to discuss serious documented circumstances. See the [Essential Policies page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/essential-policies) for details.

### Can I use my laptop during class?

I provide printed lecture notes so you can focus on discussion without devices. If you need device accommodation for disabilities, please contact me.

### What if I miss class?

Please email me before class if you must miss, and get notes from classmates. Remember to sign the attendance sheet every class for participation tracking.

### When should I complete the readings?

Readings are listed on the day they will be discussed in class. For example, you should read Badcock 11-13 before class 2.1, and we will discuss it in that class. Check the [Schedule page](/course-ntw2029/schedule) for all readings.

## Canvas and Technical Issues

### Why does Canvas show the wrong grade?

Don't panic about Canvas grades - I track grades separately in my own spreadsheet. Canvas might show confusing numbers that don't reflect your actual grade. Just ask me if you want to know your current grade.

### What Canvas notifications should I set?

Please set notifications to "Daily" or "Immediately" for Due Dates, Discussion posts, and Announcements. These notifications have saved many students from missing assignments. Instructions are on the [Essential Policies page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/essential-policies).

### What if I have technical problems during submission?

Take a screenshot of any error message, try submitting again, and if it still doesn't work, email me immediately with the screenshot and your assignment attached.

## GenAI Policy

### Is there really no penalty for using GenAI?

That's right - no grade penalty as long as you submit your chat transcript links. Obviously, your learning may suffer if you rely too heavily on it, but there's no policy violation. Full policy details on the [GenAI Policy page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy).

### How do I submit GenAI links correctly?

You must use the share function in ChatGPT to create a public link. There's a walkthrough with images on the [GenAI Policy page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy#x-walkthrough) showing exactly which buttons to click.

### Can I upload files to ChatGPT?

File uploads and downloads are not allowed under course policy. You can copy-paste text into the chat, but no file uploads. This includes ChatGPT Canvas and Claude artifacts.

### What if I forgot my GenAI disclosure?

Every assignment must include either a GenAI link or statement of non-use to earn credit. Since there's no penalty for use, please don't risk getting a zero by forgetting the disclosure.

### Do I have to use GenAI?

No, you're not expected to use GenAI. If you don't use it, just end your submission with: "I did not use GenAI in any way for this assignment."

## Conferences

### How do I book a conference?

Use Microsoft Bookings to schedule. If you see only strange times (like middle of the night), check the walkthrough on the [Conference Guidelines page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences#x-checkyoursettings) that shows how to fix your timezone settings.

### Where are conferences held?

All conferences are via Zoom. The link and meeting ID are on the [Conference Guidelines page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences).

### Can conferences be recorded?

Yes, if you request it at the beginning. I'll share the recording and transcript with you afterward. This helps if you want to review our discussion later.

### How should I prepare for conferences?

Review the assignment instructions and your submission beforehand. Come with specific questions - the conference is a time for you to use me as a resource. More preparation tips on the [Conference Guidelines page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences).

## Grading

### How is my grade calculated?

Class participation: 15%, Writing Development Work: 15%, Paper 1: 30%, Paper 2: 40%. Full breakdown with details on the [Grading page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/grading).

### What counts as "complete" for exercises?

Submit by the deadline (or within 12-hour extension), include all required elements, and add your GenAI disclosure. You'll get full credit (1 point) for complete work, 0.5 points if you fix it after feedback within one week, or 0 points for incomplete work.

### Can I resubmit exercises?

Yes! You have one week to fix and resubmit for half credit. You get one resubmission per exercise.

### What is SRL?

Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) adjusts your Writing Development grade based on how actively you work to improve throughout the course. Details about how this works are on the [Grading page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/grading#x-why-i-incorporate-srl).

### What if I get an incomplete on an exercise?

Don't worry too much - each exercise is a very small part of your final grade. However, all paper prep assignments must be submitted at minimum acceptable quality to pass the course.

## Assignments

### What format should I submit assignments in?

Always submit as a Word document (.docx) - not Pages, PDF, or Google Docs. Include your name and section at the top, word count and GenAI disclosure at the bottom. Full formatting details on the [Assignments page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/assignments).

### How should I format papers?

Download the [paper template](/downloads/ntw2029-paper.docx) for easiest formatting, or see the detailed instructions on the [Assignments page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/assignments#x-full-formatting-details).

### What should I highlight in my papers?

Highlight your thesis statement in yellow (2 sentences maximum) and all topic sentences in light blue. This applies to drafts and final papers, not exercises.

### Can I resubmit before the deadline?

Yes - unlimited resubmissions until the deadline. Only your last submission is graded.

### Should I spend more than 2 hours on exercises?

Please don't! Exercises are for practice and learning, not for evaluating you. If you hit 2 hours, submit what you have.

## Writing Questions

### How much should I quote versus paraphrase?

Most of your paper should be paraphrasing with citations. Quote only when the exact wording matters or the phrasing is particularly elegant. I'll show you examples of good balance in class.

### What's the difference between Paper 1 and Paper 2?

Paper 1 asks you to explain (and optionally analyze) Pinker's arguments about why we enjoy art. Paper 2 asks you to explain, analyze, and evaluate a source about EP and art, adding your own ideas to the academic conversation. Detailed requirements for each are on their assignment pages.

### What does "adding to the academic conversation" mean?

You might point out unstated assumptions, identify missing evidence, show logical gaps, or explain implications the author didn't discuss. You're working with what's there, not inventing new theories.

### How do I know if a source is suitable for Paper 2?

Good sources make specific EP claims about art, have clear arguments you can analyze, and give you something to critique or extend. Avoid sources that only mention EP briefly or are too technical to understand fully.

### Can I change my source after starting?

It's possible, but consider your time constraints. If you realize early that your source won't work, it's worth switching. If you're deep into the assignment, you might do better working with what you have.

### How should I structure my introduction?

Start broad with the general topic, narrow to your specific focus, provide context for why it matters, then state your thesis. Typically 1-2 paragraphs. Examples are discussed in class.

## Course Content

### Do I need to understand all the biology?

You'll be okay! I'll explain what you need to know. Just ask me if you have questions - if you're confused, others probably are too.

### What textbooks are required?

The main readings from Pinker, Boyd, and others are provided on the website. "They Say / I Say" (TSIS) and "The Craft of Research" (COR) are recommended resources but not required purchases.

### Can I see examples of good papers?

I provide anonymized examples on the website and discuss them in class. Check the resources section for these examples.

## Support

### When are office hours?

[Check Canvas or ask me for current office hours]

### Is attendance mandatory?

Yes, attendance is part of your participation grade (15%). Please sign the attendance sheet every class.

### What if website instructions seem unclear?

Please email me with specifics about what's confusing. It would help me improve the website for you and future students.

### How many sources do I need for papers?

Paper 1 uses just Pinker. Paper 2 needs one main source plus at least 3 others for context. Specific requirements are on each paper's assignment page.

### What citation style should I use?

APA style for all papers. See the Citations resources page for detailed guidance and examples.
