These FAQs cover topics that don't fit on other specific pages. For topic-specific questions, see the relevant course pages.

## Website and Technical

### When will you update [course website page]?

It's actually updated; you probably need to reload the page. Your browser sometimes shows you an old cached version of the website instead of the latest updates. To see the current version:

**Windows**: Press Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R to force a full refresh that clears the cache for that page.

**Mac**: Press Cmd+Shift+R in most browsers, or hold Shift while clicking the reload button. In Safari, use Cmd+Option+R.

If that doesn't work, please reboot and try again, and if you still don't see what you expect, let me know.

### What if website instructions seem unclear?

Please email me with specifics about what's confusing. It would help me improve the website for you and future students.

## Course Content

### Do I need to understand all the biology?

You'll be okay! I'll explain what you need to know. Just ask me if you have questions - if you're confused, others probably are too.

### What textbooks are required?

The main readings from Pinker, Boyd, and others are provided on the website. "They Say / I Say" (TSIS) and "The Craft of Research" (COR) are recommended resources but not required purchases.

### Can I see examples of good papers?

I provide anonymized examples on the website and discuss them in class. Check the resources section for these examples.

<!--
### Why don't you allow electronic devices in class?

XXX - I provide printed lecture notes so you can focus on discussion without devices. If you need device accommodation for disabilities, please contact me.
