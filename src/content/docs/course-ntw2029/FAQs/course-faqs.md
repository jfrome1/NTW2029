## Communication

### How should I contact you?

Use email for formal requests like extensions or grade concerns - just include "NTW2029" in the subject line so your email goes to the right folder. For quick questions, use our Telegram class chat. You can also grab me after class for brief questions. Full details on the [Communication & Support page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/communication-support).

### You didn't answer my email, what do I do?

Please email me again if you don't hear back within one business day. Sometimes emails without "NTW2029" in the subject get lost among administrative emails.

### Can I message you on Canvas or call you?

I don't check Canvas messages or office voicemail, so please use email or Telegram instead.

## Policies and Deadlines

### Can I submit assignments late or get an extension?

Yes! You can submit any assignment (except assignments for peer review) up to 12 hours late. Just submit by noon the next day without emailing me. This policy applies to final papers. For longer extensions, see the [Essential Policies page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/essential-policies) for details.

### Why don't you allow electronic devices in class?

XXX - I provide printed lecture notes so you can focus on discussion without devices. If you need device accommodation for disabilities, please contact me.

### What if I miss class?

Please email me before class if you must miss, and ask a classmate to get you notes and handouts.

### When are the readings due?

Readings are listed on the day they will be discussed in class. For example, you should read Badcock 11-13 before class 2.1, and we will discuss it in that class. Check the [Schedule page](/course-ntw2029/schedule) for all readings.

## Canvas and Technical Issues

### Why is Canvas showing the wrong grade?

Don't panic about Canvas grades - I track grades separately in my own spreadsheet. Canvas might show confusing numbers that don't reflect your actual grade.

### Why didn't I get notified that you posted comments on my assignment?

Please set Canvas notifications to "Daily" or "Immediately" for Due Dates, Discussion posts, and Announcements. These notifications have saved many students from missing assignments. Instructions are on the [Essential Policies page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/essential-policies).

### What if I have technical problems during submission?

Take a screenshot of any error message, try submitting again, and if it still doesn't work, email me immediately with the screenshot and your assignment attached.

### When will you update [course website page]?

It's actually updated; you probably need to reload the page. Your browser sometimes shows you an old cached version of the website instead of the latest updates. To see the current version:

**Windows**: Press Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R to force a full refresh that clears the cache for that page.

**Mac**: Press Cmd+Shift+R in most browsers, or hold Shift while clicking the reload button. In Safari, use Cmd+Option+R.

If that doesn't work, please reboot and try again, and if you still don't see what you expect, let me know.

## GenAI Policy

### Is there really no penalty for using GenAI?

That's right - no grade penalty as long as you submit your chat transcript links. Obviously, your learning may suffer if you rely too heavily on it, but there's no policy violation. Full policy details on the [GenAI Policy page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/gen-ai-policy).

### Can I upload files to ChatGPT?

File uploads and downloads are not allowed under course policy. You can copy-paste text into the chat, but no file uploads. This includes ChatGPT Canvas and Claude artifacts.

### What if I forget my GenAI declaration?

Every assignment must include either a GenAI link or statement of non-use to earn credit. Since there's no penalty for use, please don't risk getting a zero by forgetting the disclosure.

For exercises, if the declaration is missing, the assignment will be marked "incomplete" and you can resubmit with a working link within a week to get half credit. If not, no credit.

For papers, DON'T FORGET your declaration and check all links, because lack of declaration is an academic honestly violation, and we don't want that to happen.

### Do I have to use GenAI?

No, you're not expected to use GenAI. If you don't use it, just end your submission with: "I did not use GenAI in any way for this assignment."

## Conferences

### How do I book a conference?

Use Microsoft Bookings to schedule. If you see only strange times (like middle of the night), check the walkthrough on the [Conference Guidelines page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences#x-checkyoursettings) that shows how to fix your timezone settings.

### Where are conferences held?

All conferences are via Zoom. The link and meeting ID are on the [Conference Guidelines page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences).

### Can conferences be recorded?

Yes, if you request it at the beginning. I'll share the recording and transcript with you afterward. This helps if you want to review our discussion later.

### How should I prepare for conferences?

Review the assignment instructions and your submission beforehand. Come with specific questions - the conference is a time for you to use me as a resource. More preparation tips on the [Conference Guidelines page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/conferences).

## Grading

### How is my grade calculated?

Class participation: 15%, Writing Development Work: 15%, Paper 1: 30%, Paper 2: 40%. Full breakdown with details on the [Grading page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/grading).

### What counts as "complete" for exercises?

Submit by the deadline (or within 12-hour extension), include all required elements, and add your GenAI disclosure. You'll get full credit (1 point) for complete work, 0.5 points if you fix it after feedback within one week, or 0 points for incomplete work.

### Can I resubmit exercises?

Yes! You have one week to fix and resubmit for half credit. You get one resubmission per exercise.

### What is SRL?

Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) adjusts your Writing Development grade based on how actively you work to improve throughout the course. Details about how this works are on the [Grading page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/grading#x-why-i-incorporate-srl).

### What if I get an incomplete on an exercise?

Don't worry too much - each exercise is a very small part of your final grade. However, all paper prep assignments must be submitted at minimum acceptable quality to pass the course.

## Assignments

### What file type should I use for assignments?

Always submit as a Word document (.docx) - not Pages, PDF, or Google Docs. Include your name and section at the top, word count and GenAI disclosure at the top. Full formatting details on the [Assignments page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/assignments).

### How should I format papers?

Download the [paper template](/downloads/ntw2029-paper.docx) for easiest formatting, or see the detailed instructions on the [Assignments page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/assignments#x-full-formatting-details).

### What should I highlight in my papers?

Highlight your thesis statement in yellow (2 sentences maximum) and all topic sentences in light blue. This applies to drafts and final papers, not exercises.

### Can I resubmit before the deadline?

Yes - unlimited resubmissions until the deadline. Only your last submission is graded.

### How long should I spend on the exercises?

Exercises are for practice and learning, not for evaluating mastry. Don't spend more than 2 hours on exercises (excluding reading time).

### Should we include the citations or references in the word count?

Include in-text citations in your word count, but exclude the reference list at the end. So if you write "Pinker (1997, p. 45) argues that..." those words all count toward your total.

### What's the paper template?

The paper template is a pre-formatted Word document that has all the correct formatting already set up for you - double-spacing, margins, indentation, font, and heading styles. It's like a fill-in-the-blank document where you just replace the placeholder text with your own writing.

Using the template saves you from formatting headaches and prevents losing points for formatting errors. Just download it, save it with a new name for your assignment, and start typing. The template handles things like:

- First-line indentation for paragraphs
- Proper spacing between paragraphs (no extra blank lines)
- Correct font and size
- Title and reference list formatting

You can download it from the [Assignments page](/course-ntw2029/course-info/assignments) and use it for all your papers. Trust me, it's much easier than trying to format everything yourself!

## Course Content

### Do I need to understand all the biology?

You'll be okay! I'll explain what you need to know. Just ask me if you have questions - if you're confused, others probably are too.

### What textbooks are required?

The main readings from Pinker, Boyd, and others are provided on the website. "They Say / I Say" (TSIS) and "The Craft of Research" (COR) are recommended resources but not required purchases.

### Can I see examples of good papers?

I provide anonymized examples on the website and discuss them in class. Check the resources section for these examples.

## Support

### When are office hours?

[Check Canvas or ask me for current office hours]

### Is attendance mandatory?

Yes, attendance is part of your participation grade (15%). Please sign the attendance sheet every class.

### What if website instructions seem unclear?

Please email me with specifics about what's confusing. It would help me improve the website for you and future students.
