## Topic Sentences and Paragraph Structure

### What makes a good topic sentence?

A topic sentence should fully capture the one main idea of the paragraph. A reader who reads only the first sentence of each paragraph should be able to follow your paper's entire argument. Details on the [Topic Sentences page](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/topic-sentences).

### Where should topic sentences go?

Topic sentences should be at the beginning of each body paragraph unless you have a good reason to place them elsewhere. They're usually one sentence long, but sometimes two sentences are necessary.

### How do I connect paragraphs smoothly?

Topic sentences are usually combined with transitions. They might begin with a transition word or phrase linking the previous paragraph to the current paragraph. Always move from old to new information - recap the previous idea briefly, then introduce the new one.

## Analysis vs. Summary

### What's the difference between analyzing and summarizing?

Analyzing means seeing how the parts of an argument contribute to the claim - identifying implicit and explicit reasons, evidence, and assumptions. It means noting gaps or problems in the connections. Summary just reports what the source says. See [Analyzing Arguments](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/analyzing-arguments) for details.

### What questions should I ask when analyzing?

Ask yourself: Is this source claim actually true? How important is it to the overall argument? Does it rely on concepts whose meaning is hard to pin down? If the source criticizes other theories, can the same criticisms be made about their argument? More questions on the [Analysis Questions page](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/analysis-questions).

### How do I know if I'm analyzing deeply enough?

After identifying the key claims, go through and look for steps that are skipped or unexplained, explanations that don't make sense, or arguments that are unpersuasive. Your analysis should make implicit aspects explicit.

## Introductions

### How should I structure my introduction?

Start broadly with the general topic, get more specific, and end with your thesis. First introduce the topic to a reader who has no idea what you're talking about. Then introduce the specific topic, the disagreement that motivates the academic conversation, provide context for understanding your thesis, then present the thesis. Details on the [Introductions page](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/introductions-orienting).

### Should I use a hook?

Don't obsess over your first sentence, and don't try too hard to be catchy. If you use an anecdote, make sure it leads directly to your main point. At all costs, avoid cliche openings like "For thousands of years, humans have made art."

### Should I include a roadmap?

For our course's shorter papers, your thesis acts as a roadmap, so you shouldn't include a separate roadmap unless I specifically recommend it for your paper.

### Why are introductions so important?

Introductions are essential for helping your reader understand your paper. Without context, readers have no idea what to focus on and it's very hard to understand what you're talking about. They're much more important than conclusions.

## Quotations and Paraphrasing

### When should I quote vs. paraphrase?

Quote only when the exact wording matters or the phrasing is particularly elegant. Most of your paper should be paraphrasing with citations. See examples of good balance in class and on the [Citations page](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/citations).

### How do I frame quotes properly?

Use three-part framing for quotes longer than a short phrase: introduce the quote, present it, then interpret or explain it. Don't let quotes speak for themselves - always explain how they support your point.

### Do I need to cite paraphrases?

Yes! Citation is required whether you use exact words (quotation) or state ideas in your own words (paraphrase/summary). It doesn't matter where you got the ideas - you must cite them.

## Academic Writing Basics

### What's "academic writing as conversation"?

Academic writing means joining an ongoing scholarly discussion. You're not just presenting information - you're responding to what others have said and adding your own ideas. Details on the [Academic Conversations page](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/academic-conversations).

### How formal should my writing be?

Use formal academic style but prioritize clarity. Choose simple, clear language over complex vocabulary. Avoid unnecessarily complicated sentences that might confuse readers.

### What are common ESL issues I should watch for?

Common issues include article usage (a/an/the), subject-verb agreement, and unclear referents. The [Chinese ESL Issues page](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/chinese-esl-issues) and [Unclear Referent page](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing/unclear-referent) have specific guidance.

## Paper Development

### How do I develop a strong thesis?

Your thesis should be contestable - someone could disagree with it. Avoid descriptive statements like "I will explicate X." Make a specific claim that you'll defend with evidence and reasoning.

### How do I know if my argument is strong enough?

Strong arguments have clear connections between claims, reasons, and evidence. Each part should explicitly support your thesis. If you're just listing points without showing how they connect, you need more analysis.

## Getting Help

### When should I ask for help with writing?

Ask early when you're confused about concepts or requirements. Don't wait until just before the deadline. I'm happy to clarify assignments or discuss your approach, but I can't review drafts outside of formal submissions.

### What resources are available for writing help?

Beyond these FAQ pages, check the full [Writing Resources section](/course-ntw2029/resources/writing) for detailed guides. You can also use university writing centers and librarians for citation help.

### Can I see examples of good writing?

I provide anonymized examples on the website and discuss them in class. Pay attention to the examples we analyze together - they show what I'm looking for in your papers.

## Writing Questions

### How much should I quote versus paraphrase?

Most of your paper should be paraphrasing with citations. Quote only when the exact wording matters or the phrasing is particularly elegant. I'll show you examples of good balance in class.

### What's the difference between Paper 1 and Paper 2?

Paper 1 asks you to explain (and optionally analyze) Pinker's arguments about why we enjoy art. Paper 2 asks you to explain, analyze, and evaluate a source about EP and art, adding your own ideas to the academic conversation. Detailed requirements for each are on their assignment pages.

### What does "adding to the academic conversation" mean?

You might point out unstated assumptions, identify missing evidence, show logical gaps, or explain implications the author didn't discuss.

### How should I structure my introduction?

Start broad by introducing the general topic, narrow to your specific focus, make sure the reader understands why people are discussing this specific topic, provide context for why the discussion matters, then state your thesis. The introduction for course papers should be one to two paragraphs, and should end before the mid-point of page two. See course materials on introductions for more guidance.

### How many sources do I need for papers?

Paper 1 uses just one source. Paper 2 needs one target source, one commentary source, and at least two other sources for context.

### What citation style should I use?

Use APA style for all papers. See the Citations resources page for detailed guidance and examples.

### Should we include in-text citations or the reference list in the word count?

Include in-text citations in your word count, but not the reference list at the end.
