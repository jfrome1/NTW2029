There are several grammar issues commonly faced by native Chinese speakers when writing English (although native English speakers make these mistakes also!). I recommend that you read this useful handout about [Common English mistakes made by native Chinese speakers](/downloads/chinese-english-mistakes.pdf)

If you have questions about any of these issues, please ask and I'll help you.

## Verb tense:

- for verb tenses in general, see [Introduction to Verb Tenses - Purdue OWL®](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/verb_tenses/index.html)
- for verb tenses in writing about what sources do (e.g. says, writes, argues), see [here](/course-ntw2029/resources/grammar/#verb-tenses)



## Plurals:

Problems with plurals in this class usually involve whether to treat abstractions as plurals, but all of the resources I found for avoiding mistakes with English plurals were about basic nouns like "chair/chairs". If you know of any better resources, please send them to me
