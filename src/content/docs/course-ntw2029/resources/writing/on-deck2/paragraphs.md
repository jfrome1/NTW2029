- In this course, paragraphs should (almost always) begin with a topic sentence that fully captures the main idea of the paragraph.
	- Exceptions exist for introductions, conclusions, or paragraphs that need a transition sentence that pushes the topic sentence to the 2nd position in a paragraph.
	- There may be other reasons to not start with a topic sentence, so ask me if you think there is a good reason to not do this.
	- For example, this paragraph from Pinker begins with a transition sentence that announces the main idea of the section (that the arts are not adaptive, the sentence is sort of a topic sentence for the section as a whole), but the sentence following it is the topic sentence that captures the main idea of the paragraph, which is that not everything the adapted mind does is adaptive:
		- _Another reason the psychology of the arts is obscure is that they are not adaptive in the biologist's sense of the word. This book has been about the adaptive design of the major components of the mind, but that does not mean that I believe that everything the mind does is biologically adaptive. The mind is a neural computer, fitted by natural selection with combinatorial algorithms for causal and probabilistic reasoning about plants, animals, objects, and people. It is driven by goal states that served biological fitness in ancestral environments, such as food, sex, safety, parenthood, friendship, status, and knowledge. That toolbox, however, can be used to assemble Sunday afternoon projects of dubious adaptive value._ (524)
		- if putting this on the website only, restructure to make it clearer how the example works
- The main idea of the paragraph should be fully captured by the topic sentence.
- Each paragraph should convey just one main idea, not two or more ideas.
- Since paragraphs are distinct units in a paper, each new paragraph is sort of a "fresh start", and you should reorient the reader when referring to past paragraphs.
	- In each new paragraph, rename any authors, ideas, or objects from previous paragraphs rather than referring to them with pronouns or other general references. It doesn't matter if you just mentioned the referent, you must rename it in each paragraph.
		- e.g. 1
			- Avoid: "This argument suggests..."
			- Better: "The argument that sadness contributes to viewer pleasure suggests..."
		- e.g. 2
			- Avoid: "However, they also argue..."
			- Better: "However, Dumbord and Baumard also argue..."
		- e.g. 3
			- Avoid: "For all of these reasons, we must..."
			- Better: "The source arguments' ambiguity and lack of significance suggest that we must..."
	- In each new paragraph, attribute all claims to make clear whether they are your claims or a source's.
		- e.g. 1
			- Avoid: "In addition to their varied pitch, infants like songs because..."
			- Better: ""In addition to their varied pitch, Hackett argues, infants like songs because..."
- The main idea is sometimes the "conclusion" of what you say in the paragraph, but don't put this idea only at the end. Even if you have to set up several ideas to support your main idea, give the main point at the beginning, in the topic sentence, so the reader knows what you are planning to show in the paragraph.
	- e.g. stating main claim of paragraph at the end:
		- > Firstly, cooperation is a naturally selected trait  because, in an ideal scenario , cooperation will increase the chances of the individual's genes being passed down, be it through the reproduction of a relative or themselves. Humans cooperate with family members because they share a high proportion of the same genes, thus ensuring the survival of their kin also ensures that these shared genes get passed down . Cooperating with non-kin, however, can also benefit the survival of the individual if all collaborators faithfully repay favors done for one another, or if they work together to achieve a common benefit for all. Secondly, and more obviously, securing a mate benefits an individual's ability to pass their genes on to successive generations since a mate is necessary for individuals to reproduce in the first place. Therefore, since language allows for more efficient cooperation and mate selection which in turn promote reproductive fitness, Dunbar's stance that the evolution of language was for 'social purposes' (133) is indeed a plausible one.
- FAQs
	- "Should all paragraphs be structured and built the same way?"
		- Most paragraphs will be similarly structured. Some paragraphs are structured differently because they have special roles, such as introductions, conclusions, or paragraphs addressing objections/counterexamples (which, e.g., might not start with a topic sentences).
	- "Should all of our paragraphs be the same length or is that not important?"
		- Paragraph length will vary based on the complexity of the paragraph's main idea. Focus less on length and more on keeping each paragraph to one main idea.
