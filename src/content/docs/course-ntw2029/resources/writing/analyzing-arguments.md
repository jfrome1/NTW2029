- arguments involve giving reasons and evidence that a claim is true or false
- your arguments can only persuade someone else if you both already agree on some assumptions/underlying beliefs, which are often unstated
- elements of arguments:
	- Claim: your point, what you want your reader to believe; your thesis is the main claim of your paper
	- Reason: an assertion that supports your claim and leads your reader to accept it, often joined to a claim with "because"
	- Evidence: facts presented to support a reason; what counts as good evidence varies by discipline
	- Assumptions (warrants): beliefs that others must hold for your reasons and evidence to convince them your claim is true
- how are reasons are different than assumptions?
	- reasons are usually explicit and assumptions are usually implicit
	- assumptions are sometimes stated explicitly, i.e. "this argument assumes that art evolved from animal signals"; in this case, the author is telling the reader that their argument relies on a claim (the assumption) that they don't intend to defend
- note: these categories are to help you analyze arguments; it's not essential to classify all parts of an argument "correctly", and some parts can be put under more than one category
- analyzing an argument means seeing how the parts of argument contribute to the claim
	- identifying implicit and explicit reasons, evidence, and assumptions used to support the claim
	- noting any gaps or problems in the connections between these parts
	- gaps or problems can mean:
		- steps that are skipped or are unexplained
		- explanations that don't make sense
		- arguments that are unpersuasive
- after identifying the key claims in the source argument, go through the source claims and ask yourself questions such as:
	- is this source claim actually true?
	- is this source claim true in every case, in most cases, in some cases, or rarely?
	- how important is this source claim to the overall argument?
	- does this source claim rely on concepts whose meaning is hard to pin down?
	- if the source criticizes other theories, can the same criticisms be made about the source's argument?
