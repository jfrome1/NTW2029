- at its most basic, explanation is helping someone understand something by helping them see how its parts are connected
	- these "parts" might be ideas, facts, actions, etc.
- you need to explain sources to use them in your discussion
	- most sources need explanation because they are not easy to understand, especially for your generalist target audience
	- aim to make your source explanations clearer and easier to understand than the original
- explaining a source usually involves both summarizing and explicating
	- summarize (condense into fewer words)
		- usually you are explaining only part of a source, such as a key argument, so you don't have to include all of the details of the source (if you did, your explanation would be longer than the original)
		- you will choose what parts of the source to discuss or ignore; you might summarize large passages in just a few words if the details are not important for your explanation
	- explicate (expand into more words)
		- sources are hard to understand in part because many parts of their arguments are implicit
		- your generalist reader won't have the knowledge to understand these implicit parts
		- you also want to make it as easy as possible for your reader, so do the work for them by making the implicit parts explicit and connecting the parts of the argument for them
		- doing these things for the reader will take more words than used in the original source
- specific strategies for clear explanations
	- define terms the reader may not know
		- break down complex ideas and explain them to the reader in parts
		- put information in the right order so it is easy for the reader to connect each phrase and sentence to the ones next to it
		- make implicit connections explicit
			- do not stop short when connecting the ideas togetherâ€”take it all the way to show the relationship to the topic sentence and/or thesis
		- illustrate abstract claims with concrete examples (real or imagined)
			- make abstract claim
			- illustrate with a concrete example (if claim's meaning and potentially application would not be obvious to a generalist reader)
			- explain how the example demonstrates the claim (always!)
