## Purpose of citation

Proper citations are essential for [:an author's credibility](#x-an-authors-credibility).

Citations are important for [:helping your readers](#x-helping-your-readers).

Proper citation is [:ethically important](#x-ethically-important).

## When is citation required?

- In this course, both in-text citations and a reference list are required _for all assignments_ unless stated otherwise.
- Provide citations to the original source every time you [:use others' ideas](#x-use-others-ideas).
- Most plagiarism is [:unintentional](#x-unintentional); but failure to cite can have serious consequences, including failing the assignment or course.
- Two exceptions to citation: [:common knowledge](#x-common-knowledge) and [:information from class](#x-information-from-class)

## Do not make the following mistakes:

- Do not copy [:the citations I put](#x-the-citations-I-put) on Canvas, this website, or handouts
- Do not [:copy and paste text](#x-copy-and-paste-text) into your reference list
- Do not blindly trust online tools or [:software citation tools](#x-software-citation-tools)

It is fine to use tools such as Zotero for citations (I do) but you must check the information you put into tools and double-check the output for errors.

## How to cite sources for this course

There are two parts to citing sources:

- citing sources in-text, within the assignment's sentences
- adding a reference list with full citation information at the end of the assignment

### In-text citations

- In-text citations are short pieces of information, put in parentheses, in the main text of academic papers, like this (Frome, 2021, 65).
- Put in-text citations whenever you write information that came from a source, but not in [:every single sentence](#x-every-single-sentence).
- For in-text citations, the sentence period/full stop should always go after the last parentheses when the citation is at the end of the sentence.
- For in-text citations, follow my guidelines rather than APA guidelines.
- The basic in-text citation format you should use is (authors' last names, year source was published, page numbers [no "p." is needed]), but most in-text citations after the first one should omit some of this information. Change the citations based on these questions:
- Does the source have [:more than one author](#x-more-than-one-author)?
- Do you [:cite the source more than once](#x-cite-the-source-more-than-once) in the paper?
- Did you [:already mention the author or year](#x-already-mention-the-author-or-year) in the sentence?
- Are you [:citing the source as a whole](#x-citing-the-source-as-a-whole) rather than an idea that appears on a particular page?
- Of course, additional [:exceptions exist](#x-exceptions-exist).

### Reference list: use APA formatting

- Assignments should format the reference list in accordance with American Psychological Association (APA) [:formatting rules](#x-formatting-rules)
- Proper reference list formatting includes two elements, and you must check the rules for both:
- formatting the reference list itself
- formatting the individual entries on the list (i.e. the full citations)

:::caution

For URLs, you MUST locate and use the [DOI or DOI link](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/) for the source. You cannot simply copy and paste the URL for the webpage where you found the source. If there is no DOI, use [:the official publisher's URL](#x-the-official-publishers-url)

:::

## Citations and grading

- Papers not using proper format for in-text citations and the reference list will incur a grade penalty.
- I am happy to look at your citations in person.
- PLEASE [:do not send me your citations](#x-do-not-send-me-your-citations) and ask me to check them for you (although it's fine for you to ask me a specific, detailed question, e.g. if you have an unusual situation that is not covered by the guidelines here).

:::tip

It's usually not efficient to format all your in-text citations as you draft your paper. In fact, sometimes interrupting your writing to go look up a specific date or page could distract your focus. I usually put (YYYY) or (p) if I don't have the information handy when drafting and add it in later.

:::

## Citations checklist

- include in-text citations for paraphrasing AND quotations (not just quotes; should have at least a few in-text citations in almost every paragraph)
- check reference list (hanging indents, spacing, etc.)
- check items in reference list (APA style, correct italics, etc.)
- check in-text citations using instructions above (names mentioned only as necessary, no "p.", etc.)

## Self-guided Quiz for in-text citation errors

I've created a quiz for you to [:test yourself on in-text citation](#x-test-yourself-on-in-text-citation)

I've created a quiz for you to [:test yourself on reference list citation](#x-test-yourself-on-reference-list-citation).

## In-text citation: questions about style

You might be interested in [:some advanced questions](#x-some-advanced-questions) about writing style and citation.

##### :x an authors credibility

- They demonstrate to readers that the author got their information from credible sources.
- They convey the message, "I have nothing to hide. If you don't trust my claims about these sources, you can go check them yourself."
- Lack of proper citations (including proper formatting) suggests that the author didn't produce the paper with attention to detail and may be committing plagiarism.

##### :x helping your readers

- Readers need a way to easily find the sources you are discussing so they can confirm whether they agree with your interpretation of those sources.
- Readers doing research in the same area will want to be able to find your sources.
- Readers often skim reference lists to quickly check if a paper references important and recent sources.

##### :x ethically important

Scholars devote their professional lives to generating and disseminating ideas. Usually, they forego more lucrative careers do do so. The primary reward they receive is others publicly recognizing their ideas by citing them. Using someone's ideas without crediting them is essentially stealing their labor. You should properly cite sources because it takes minimal effort and is the right thing to do.

##### :x use others ideas

Citation is to tell the reader where you got any ideas, reasons, or evidence that were not created by you alone.

- It doesn't matter where you got the ideas (whether published, online, or personal communication).
- It doesn't matter whether you use the exact words of a source (quotation) or state the idea in your own words (paraphrase/summary). Read section 14.6 of [_The Craft of Research_](https://go.exlibris.link/fFKws0JQ) for clarification and examples.

##### :x unintentional

Students often do not know when they must cite sources, but it is your responsibility to learn and to do it correctly.

##### :x common knowledge

You don't need to cite sources for common knowledge or obvious observations.

For example, this passage has unnecessary citations:

> These games are based on player skill and performance (Grodal, 2003), focusing on how players experience and perform in the game. Fitness-related stimuli like obstacles and actions are aplenty. Not performing these actions well can result in failure to meet gameplay objectives, such as clearing a level or defeating a boss enemy. Failure often results in loss of life, energy, or game termination (Juul, 2009).

It is common knowledge that games often require skill and that failing in a videogame often results in losing a life.

##### :x information from class

You need to cite ideas from assigned readings or other sources, whether or not I talk about them in class.

You don't need to cite any unsourced ideas I give you, in or out of class, in assignments submitted to me unless you are referencing something I published.

##### :x software citation tools

Online citations _cannot be trusted_; they often have bad information or make mistakes. You MUST proofread your citations against the actual rules of your paper's formatting style (in our course, APA), which are provided below. You are responsible for confirming that the citations are correct.

##### :x the citations I put

When I provide citations, I often deviate from proper format for course-related reasons, such as specifying a chapter in a book. Proper citations in a paper reference list don't specify book chapters; you just cite the book as a whole. I also sometimes include page numbers to help you estimate reading time, even if they are not needed in a reference list.

##### :x copy and paste text

Students often have problems with the reference list when they copy and paste text into the list from other documents. This process often messes up their formatting. If you copy and paste citations, double-check your fonts (use only one), spacing, line breaks, italics, and other formatting elements.

##### :x every single sentence

In this course, the main purpose of in-text citation is for me to be able to find the place in your source that you are discussing. Sometimes, students paraphrase or quote sources as saying things that seem unlikely or surprising to me, and I want to check to see if I read the source in the same way.

In-text citations should be included frequently enough that I can easily find the location students are discussing, but not in every sentence, which might interrupt reading flow.

My guidelines are: 1) have at least one in-text citation in each paragraph that uses a source's ideas, and 2) include a new in-text citation if the relevant page changes.

In all honesty, most academic papers do not focus extensively on closely explaining or analyzing just one source in the way that our assignments do, so you won't see so many citations in published sources.

##### :x more than one author

Follow these examples:

- (Alibali, 2019, 37) - for a source with one author
- (Alibali & Moore, 2019, 37) - for a source with two authors
- (Alibali et al., 2019, 37) - for a source with more than two authors

Note that in `et al.`, nothing is capitalized, there's a space between "et" and "al", there's no period after "et", and there's a period after "al", regardless of any additional punctuation.

##### :x cite the source more than once

If there is only one source with the same author, then you include the year of the source _only the first time_ you cite/mention the source, because the reader can use that first mention to clearly identify the source in your reference list. Example:
> Alibali's (2019) mixed-methods study found that children represent mathematical problems best on paper (20). Alibali concluded that computers should not be used to teach elementary math (31). (you don't need the year in the second sentence)

If you have more than one source with the same author, then you need to include the year each time you mention the source, as the reader needs a way to know which of the sources by that same author you are referencing.

##### :x already mention the author or year

You don't want to repeat citation information you've already presented in the same sentence. If you mention the author(s) in the sentence, don't repeat the name(s) in the in-text citation. Put the year directly after the author's name and put the page number in-text separately, after the cited information, usually at the end of the sentence. Examples:
> Alibali's (2019) mixed-methods study found that children represent mathematical problems best on paper (20).
>
> In a case study of a 3rd-grade classroom, Zhang (2017) explored the implementation of a new curriculum (5).

##### :x citing the source as a whole

If you are citing a source as a whole, rather than a specific idea in the source, no page number is needed:

- Researchers have studied how children represent mathematical problems (Alibali & Moore, 2019).

##### :x exceptions exist

There are lots of uncommon exceptions or additional rules for unusual situations (e.g., two authors with the same last name, two works with the same authors published in the same year, personal communication, indirect sources, etc.). Don't try to guess the correct way to handle these; after confirming that these guidelines don't answer your questions, proactively ask me how to do the citation. It is ok in these rare cases.

##### :x formatting rules

You can review APA rules many places online, including [here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/index.html).

You can download a handout with APA formatting instructions [here](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/documentation/docapa/). The section about reference list formatting is section 7. Ignore other sections of the handout.

APA guidelines on citing book chapters is [here](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/book-chapters)

##### :x the official publishers url

When you include a URL in your citation, the purpose is to help the reader locate the correct, official version of the source. However, you might have found copies of publications in online repositories that don't offer full citation information or the final version of a work. These links are also not well-maintained and may cease to work, unlike the official links.

To locate the correct citation URL for an article, search for the article title on the NUS library website. If you don't find the article right away, search for the name of the journal the article appeared in on the NUS library website and click through to the journal webpage. Then use either the volume and issue number, the date, or the general search function to find your specific article. Use that link.

##### :x reference

APA has a LOT of guidelines about formatting papers that you should not follow in this course, including in-text citation, running headers, and title page. For those elements, follow the course guidelines about formatting. Follow APA guidelines only for the reference list.

##### :x do not send me your citations

I'm happy to provide guidance or answer specific questions, but I can't be every student's reference list copyeditor, the same way you wouldn't send me your draft and say, "Can you look at this and mark all of the grammar errors?"

I have provided very clear instructions, there is tons of additional guidance online, you can ask for help from librarians and writing tutors. You can do this. And again, do NOT copy and paste citations from webpages or online reference tools.

<details><summary> My paper aims to propose an alternative to De Backer's (2012) "eye-witness-I-witness" theory on PSRs. She does not dwell on the difference between fictional and non-fictional media characters, simply stating that while "readers often establish bonds with fictitious characters in books," "visuals play the most important role" in PSR formation.

<details><summary> The MSB theory argues that "musicality" or the ability to create or perceive music was selected for because it promotes social bonding, accommodating increasing size and complexity of human social structures. In their article, social bonding is defined as the "formation, strengthening, and maintenance" of bonds with other individuals, bonds which form the basis of cooperative behavior. The definition that Savage et al. provide is broad, encompassing "bonding processes" and "their effects" (Savage et al., 2021, p. 2). Savage et al. argue that music is a bonding mechanism akin to grooming and gossiping as proposed by Dunbar (1993).

<details><summary> One such theory is the sexual selection hypothesis, which proposes that musicality is the biological propensity that was shaped by sexual selection (Miller, G., 2000, 1). Studies supporting the sexual selection hypothesis have revealed that there is a positive correlation between perceived mate value and Musical Performance Quality (MPQ) during ovulation (Charlton, B.D., 2014, 4). Additionally, other studies have highlighted that musicality and MPQ suggest greater health, intelligence, social class, and parenting abilities, which improves mate value (Madison et al., 2018, 9).

##### :x some advanced questions

_"When citing a source, when should you mention the source author(s) name(s) in the sentence vs. in the parenthetical in-text citation?"_

- If you are discussing your source as a primary participant in an academic conversation, name them in the sentences. If the source is being cited just as an example of a type of research or as the source of a fact supporting your claim, then put the name(s) in the parenthetical citation.

_"When citing a source, when should you mention contextual information (prominent linguist Stephen Pinker says...) about a source vs. just mentioning the name? (Stephen Pinker says...)"_

- This question must be answered on a case-by-case basis, considering your audience, where your essay is published, and the topic. Factors that are relevant in deciding whether to include contextual information (like the source's employer or discipline) include:
- Will your reader know the source or not? (if no, more likely you should provide context)
- Is the source from outside academia? (if yes, more likely you should provide context)
- Is the source from a discipline distant from the one you are writing in? (if yes, more likely you should provide context)
- Does your article discuss several sources from distinct disciplines? (if yes, more likely you should provide context)

_"When citing a source, when should you mention the source's entire name vs. just the last name?"_

- Like the above question, this is case-by-case and different disciplines have different norms. Generally, if you are discussing few authors in your writing, you're more likely to use first names.

_"How often should you include in-text citations in one paragraph when explaining a source's argument? Every sentence?"_

- For this course, err on the side of too much citation. In general, when citing, you must balance two guiding principles:
- the reader should be able to easily understand the source of any idea in a sentence (the author's vs. a source's)
- too much citation information in a sentence can interfere with the smooth flow of reading
- In short, cite as infrequently as you can, but not so infrequently that there is ever any confusion as to the source of an idea.

_"How to cite ideas from source B that you learned from source A telling you about something source B says?"_

- You must mention both sources in the sentence and cite source A in-text and in the reference list. The sentence might read something like, "According to Badcock, Sterenly argues that...(31)".
