The new  NUSC Writing Center will offer one-on-one consultations for students enrolled in Thinking With Writing (NTW) and Global Narratives (NGN). These one-hour consultations pair students with one of our peer tutors, all of whom are fellow NUSC students who have not only completed NTW and NGN coursework but also received training from and gained writing consultation experience through the NUS Library’s Writers’ Centre. These peer tutors can provide assistance on a wide range of issues pertaining to your writing assignments, such as pre-drafting brainstorming strategies; conceptualizing and revising introductions, body paragraphs, and conclusions; strengthening the relationship between claims, reasons, and evidence within and across different paragraphs; effectively positioning your voice when drawing on and navigating between multiple sources; and making use of other conventions of academic writing to help with the clear articulation and organization of your ideas. However, these consultations are not designed to “fix” your writing by way of proofreading or directive feedback. Instead, our peer tutors serve as interlocutors, whose experiences are brought to bear through dialogue in aiding writers to take greater ownership of the process. To that end, the consultations will center on your responses to questions about the aims and intentions of your work and to what extent they satisfy the expectations laid out in the assignment prompts, about where you feel there may be potential issues or barriers, and about how you believe your stated aims can be better achieved.

Consultations will be available from February 3rd to April 17th and will be held in the writing center space on the first level of the Yale-NUS Library. Appointments can be scheduled [here](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/NUSCWC@nusu.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/) (Microsoft Bookings). Please note that available consultation slots are only visible one week at a time (i.e., the current week, which the platform designates as beginning on a Sunday) and must be booked at least 24 hours in advance. For instance, in order to schedule an appointment for the Thursday of Week 7, you will need to wait until the Sunday before Week 7 to see what slots are available. Due to limited availability, the site administrators reserve the right to cancel appointments made by those who are not enrolled in a section of either NTW or NGN and those with multiple bookings in order to open up slots for eligible first-time users. If you have any questions, please contact John Rhym (jwr24@nus.edu.sg).
