title: Summarizing accurately and charitably (3.2)
date: 2025-02-09

- "they say, I say" starts with communicating and/or explaining what they say
	- ways to communicate ideas from others in your writing: paraphrase, summary, quotation, explication
		- paraphrase: restate the ideas from a text at roughly the same level of detail as the original but using different language
		- summary: restate the only the essential points of a text in a shorter form and often in a different order than the original
		- quotation: restate part of a text using the exact same wording, marked with quotation marks and citation
		- explication: restate the ideas from a text in a longer form, making implicit ideas and definitions explicit, so a generalist reader can more easily understand the ideas in the source
- summary types and purposes
	- writing summaries is not easy!
		- summaries are written for specific purposes that determine what makes a summary good or bad, e.g.:
			- summary for memorization: meant to help with you with memorization or retrieval of information, more likely to be comprehensive
			- summary for academic conversation: summarizes only the parts of the source needed to support your essay, how much you include depends on why you are including it
				- providing context or background
				- telling the reader previous claims made in the conversation
				- providing evidence for your claims
	- you do NOT have to summarize in the same order as the original source, but can reorganize the ideas to help your reader
- summarizing accurately and charitably
	- the goal of an academic conversation is (ideally) not to win the debate, but to discover what's true
	- accuracy: summaries must balance 1) accurately reflecting the source content and 2) emphasizing the content relevant to your thesis
	- charitable summaries
		- often, sources will use vague language or skip over important parts of their argument, allowing several interpretations of their position
		- it's best to follow the "principle of charity", meaning to consider the interpretation of your source most favorable to their argument (while still being accurate)
		- it can be useful to explicitly tell your reader where your source is unclear or vague, and propose different ways we might understand their argument
		- avoid "strawmanning"
			- a "straw man" is jargon for a weak argument that can be easily knocked down
			- strawmanning is summarizing someone else in a way that makes their position seem weak or wrong
			- if the source uses misleading or ambiguous terms, it is easy to strawman them, intentionally or not
			- but, strawmanning hurts your credibility and will lead to a discussion focused on the wrong thing: whether your source really said something or what they meant
			- discussion of strawman arguments does not actually add to the conversation, since it is not responding to what your source actually thinks
		- practice "steelmanning"
			- steelmanning is summarizing someone else in a way that makes their arguments even more persuasive than they are in the original source
			- steelmanning may involve rewording or modifying someone's argument so it is more persuasive or avoids certain criticisms
				- note: attribute accurately and claim credit for any changes you suggest; don't falsely suggest that the source made a stronger argument than they did
			- steelmanning helps your credibility with those who might disagree with you
			- steelmanning leads to discussion of more significant topics, such as why someone intelligent might support that argument or whether a claim is true
		- small group exercise: summarize Pinker's first paragraph uncharitably and charitably
- levels of comprehension for summaries
	- you can't explain or analyze something without understanding it
	- there is a major difference between understanding the conclusions of a source and understanding the argument used to get to those conclusions
	- analyzing a source argument requires _really_ understanding the source, including the organization of its reasoning and its evidence, as that is the only way you will be able to identify potential problems in the source
