- key structural elements for framing your thesis
	- accepted view: what we currently believe or think we know (stable context or status quo)
		- can be something generally believed, something argued or implied by a specific person, or something that seems to be going on within a text or data set
	- problem: an apparent problem with what we think we know
		- motivates the essay, tells the reader why someone might write about this topic
		- can be a gap in the accepted view, a misunderstanding in the accepted view, a problem with the question we've been asking, a contradiction in the accepted view, an unnoticed implication of the accepted view
	- thesis: a claim that addresses this problem
		- if the problem is a real-world or applied problem, the thesis will be a claim about the world
		- for Paper 2, the problem will be some issue with the source argument
- thesis-related optional elements of a good introduction
	- concession / limitation of scope, e.g.
		- why the accepted view isn't entirely wrong
		- why you will focus on a particular part of problem
			- in this course, the "problem" will be some issue with the source argument
			- you don't necessarily have to justify why you are focusing on one particular part rather than another
	- significance
		- benefit of accepting the answer or solution offered (or the cost of not doing so)
		- a solution does not need to be grand, final, or revolutionary; it might be simply that an argument must be rejected
		- avoid vague, general phrases in discussing significance, e.g.
			- "this distinction helps us better understand why viewers enjoy art"
			- "insufficient support weakens Smith's argument..."
		- significance is often revisited or elaborated in the conclusion
- other resources
	- COR Chp. 16, "Introductions and Conclusions" says introductions have three parts:
		- context: information to create a shared understanding between reader and writer about the issue that the writer will address
		- statement of the problem: a condition of incomplete knowledge or understanding, as well as the cost/consequences of that condition
		- solution to the problem: your thesis
		- (there's much more detail and many examples in the chapter)
