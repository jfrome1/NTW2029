Conclusions are much less important than introductions. Introductions are essential for helping your reader understand your paper. Conclusions serve just to close the paper and (potentially) suggest ways to continue the academic conversation.

- Elements of a good conclusion
	- DO
		- sum up your argument, starting with your main point
		- (if appropriate) extend the conversation by suggesting new questions for research
		- (if appropriate) add a new claim about significance or application (for standard research papers, not papers like Paper 2)
	- DON'T
		- introduce new arguments
		- summarize any arguments you're responding to
		- undercut your own work by introducing new doubts about your argument
