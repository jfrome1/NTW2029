Academic papers are always part of a larger conversation about their research topic. What others have written is the conversation that has happened so far. Authors add to the conversation by first explaining to readers what others have said and then presenting their own ideas.

We can think about this in terms from _They Say, I Say_. In Paper 1, you will practice the skill of explaining other people's arguments (what "they say") so you can master this skill before writing Paper 2, where you will both explain what others say and defend your own original thesis (what "I say").

- academic writing as a conversation
	- academic writing is best thought of as a response in a conversation: previous texts (or "sources") are statements in the conversation, and the paper you write is your response to those statements
		- academic writing summarizes what "they say" ("they" being other scholars) and responds with what "I say" (your response to those scholars)
		- academic writing is different than the type of writing taught for the GP, where your goal was to demonstrate your knowledge and writing ability in a very artificial writing environment
	- the conversation academic writing is part of also includes the imagined readers and potential critics of your work, and your writing will reflect your awareness that others will respond to your writing
	- one piece of academic writing often responds to many sources, all of which are contributing to the conversation
- reading academic texts as part of an academic conversation
	- when you read sources, to understand and analyze the text, you must understand the academic conversation the source is aiming to contribute to
	- having a larger context or "framework" for the source helps you understand not just the author's explicit claims, but also their larger argument and overall writing goals
	- "How do I figure out what academic conversation a source is trying to add to?"
		- often, in the introduction, authors will tell you directly what ideas they are responding to
		- if they don't tell you explicitly, you must infer who they are responding to based on their writing
	- "How do I infer the relevant conversation when I am new to a research area?"
		- rhetorical questions ("But how could evolution explain this trait?"—responding to people who think that evolution cannot explain this trait)
		- people holding opposing views, named or unnamed ("Smith argues that..." or "Skeptics may disagree, saying...")
		- writing style and tone
			- Is the writing explanatory, using ordinary language and defining any complex terms?
			- Is the writing defensive, listing counterarguments and responding to them?
			- Is the writing more exploratory, suggesting ideas to think about but offering no firm conclusion?
			- Is the writing more explanatory, discussing interesting things researchers have found and trying to provide a theory that ties them together and shows why it makes sense that these thing occur?
- writing academic texts—adding to the conversation
	- you must orient your reader to the conversation
		- from the reader's point of view, for writing to have a point, it must clearly convey what larger conversation it is contributing or responding to and why the writer's ideas matter; otherwise, the reader won't be engaged
		- writing should orient the reader to the existing conversation before presenting the thesis, so the reader is better prepared to understand why the thesis matters
		- how much and what kind of context you need to offer depends on your reader and your topic
	- ways of entering an academic conversation (these will be discussed in more detail later)
		- disagreeing and explaining why
		- agreeing with a difference (additional evidence, new application, etc.)
		- simultaneously agreeing and disagreeing
	- "Is having a conversation with sources like debating with them?"
		- it can be, but is not necessarily like that
		- many conversations are not combative, but are cooperative, with people aiming to figure out the source of disagreement so they can find solutions to problems
		- responding to others takes many forms that we will discuss in more detail later
	- when you write academic texts, regularly refer back to the existing academic conversation (what "they say") as needed, based on length of your paper, to keep the point of your paper active in the reader's mind
