- purpose
	- orient your reader so they can easily understand the paper
	- increase your reader's interest in reading the paper
- importance
	- introductions are much more important than conclusions
	- introductions are essential for helping your reader understand your paper
	- conclusions serve just to close the paper and (potentially) suggest ways to continue the academic conversation
- general structure
	- for papers geared towards a generalist reader, introductions should start quite broadly, simply introducing the topic to be discussed
	- they get more specific and end with the thesis, which is the highly specific statement of the main claim your paper defends
- specific structure
	- the first sentence or two introduces the general topic
		- introduce topic to reader who has no idea what you're talking about
		- think from the reader's point of view; without context they cannot understand why you are talking about your topic, so they have no idea what to focus on and it's very hard to understand what you are talking about
	- then introduce the specific topic
		- don't jump right into the details; give your reader enough information to form some expectations about what they might read next
	- then introduce the disagreement or issue that motivates the academic conversation about this topic
		- writing should orient the reader to the existing conversation before presenting the thesis, so the reader is better prepared to understand why the thesis matters
		- indicate why anyone would think this issue needs to be discussed (what's the questions the source is trying to answer?)
	- then explain anything needed to understand the thesis
		- i.e., provide enough context for the reader to understand the thesis
		- how much and what kind of context you need to offer depends on your reader and your topic
	- then present the thesis
		- introductions should start more generally and get more specific, and the thesis is the most specific statement of your main point and main reasons in the introduction
- optional elements of a good introduction
	- hook: anecdote, example, or question to grab your readers' attention
		- don't obsess over your first sentence, and don't try too hard to be catchy
		- if you use an anecdote make sure it leads directly to your main point
		- at all costs, avoid the dreaded cliche opening of the form, "[time period] + [topic]"
			- "For thousands of years, humans have made art."
			- "Since humans evolved, we have tried to communicate with pictures."
			- "For all recorded history, we have wondered why stories are powerful."
	- roadmap (avoid in this class):
		- a "roadmap" is several sentences offered after the thesis indicating in some detail how your essay will be organized
		- instructors differ about whether they want roadmaps in essays
		- roadmaps are especially helpful for complex, multi-part arguments in long essays
		- for simpler arguments, thesis acts as a roadmap, so you shouldn't include one unless you have asked me about it and I recommend it
