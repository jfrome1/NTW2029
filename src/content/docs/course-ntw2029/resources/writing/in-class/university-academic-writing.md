- what is the purpose of learning these types of writing?
- two main themes of clear academic writing: make it easy for your reader and think of academic writing as joining a conversation
	- academic writing is a conversation
		- academic writing is best thought of as a response in a conversation: previous texts (or "sources") are statements in the conversation, and the paper you write is your response to those statements
		- academic writing summarizes what "they say" ("they" being other scholars) and responds with what "I say" (your response to those scholars)
	- every writing choice should be based on making things easy for the reader
- NTW2029 teaches academic writing for clear communication
	- difference compared to previous instruction
		- not to fill an assignment
			- not to prove knowledge or skill to teacher
	- different types of academic writing
		- raising questions vs answering questions (we do the latter)
		- discovering reality vs creating reality (we do the former)
		- debating experts vs teaching generalists (we do mostly the latter)
		- defend a single thesis vs discuss many related ideas (we do mostly the former)
	- what I aim to teach you:
		- how to clearly explain complex ideas to a generalist reader
		- how to actually contribute to an ongoing academic conversation
