(this is just my notetaking process; not a rule or academic consensus)

- read the article/chapter/section quickly, front to back, without taking notes, to figure out the overall main point
- if there are sections, copy the section headings and subheadings, retain the hierarchy, to help organize your notes
- summarize each section in one to two sentences, or if the section is too long to do that, summarize one or more paragraphs at a time in one to two sentences
- try really hard to summarize in a way that:
	- is as short as possible, to force yourself to focus on the main idea
	- is written explicitly enough and with enough context that your "future self" in weeks or months will be able to re-read the summary and fully understand it (so e.g. avoid pronouns because in a month you might not know what "this" means in the note "this contradicts the thesis")
	- does not use the exact language of the text, to force yourself to make sure you understand the idea rather than just copying the words without understanding
	- do not let yourself use the exact phrasing of the text in your notes except in a few circumstances
- advanced guidelines - additional suggestions re: rewording original text
	- if there is a phrase that you need to include to capture the meaning of the text, but the meaning of the phrase is ambiguous, then you can quote it (as little as possible) and perhaps guess as to possible meanings
	- if there is a phrase that you might want to discuss or challenge in your notes or paper, and the exact wording is important, you can include the phrase in quotes
		- e.g., one source states, "However obvious the benefits of human brain evolution may be to most people, scientifically credible explanations are currently unknown, and no single theory has given either a completely convincing answer or one that is universally accepted." To me, the phrases "completely convincing" or "universally accepted" seem like a too-high standard, so I would circle them if notetaking by hand or retype them if typing my notes.
	- if you cannot think of a way to reword an important phrase that you want to include and do understand, and you are getting stuck spending more than 2 minutes trying to think of a new wording, then give up and quote it in your notes, but use quotation marks to avoid unintentional plagiarism
