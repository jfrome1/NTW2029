title: Keyterms (3.1)
date: 2025-01-30

- "keyterms" or "key terms" refer to the the handful of concepts central to an argument or theory
	- e.g. in Boyd, keyterms include cooperation, altruism, and evolution
- reading for keyterms
	- when reading, look for the source's keyterms (the concepts central to their argument) and ask:
		- do they define them clearly?
		- if not, what meaning does the source's use imply?
		- can the keyterms have different meanings?
			- e.g. "fitness" can refer to 1)  general health or to 2) likelihood of passing on genes through reproduction
		- does the source use them in the same ways throughout or equivocate (go back and forth) on their meaning?
			- note the difference between explicitly discussing and refining a definition of a keyterm vs. implicitly changing its meaning by just using it in different ways in different parts of the text
- writing with keyterms
	- when referring to a concept in your writing, use the _same keyterm_ throughout the paper
		- if you use the same keyterm, the reader knows you are referring to the same concept
		- if you use a different term to refer to the same concept, the reader might not be clear whether you are referring to the same concept or a different one
		- Be careful: sources do not always follow my rules to use keyterms consistently! By not using the same terms, they make it harder for you to understand them.
	- similarly, when explaining a source quotation, either use the same keyterms as the quote or explicitly connect the terms you are using to the quote's terms
	- in this course, forget writing advice you may have gotten that good writers vary your language so their writing doesn't sound boring
		- "use varied vocabulary" may be good advice for writing where artistic use of language is part of the focus, like a memoir, or poetry, or a novel
		- "use varied vocabulary" is not good advice when the focus of writing is  discussing complex ideas in a clear way, which is the case in our course
		- I'm not saying never to vary your language, I'm saying don't vary how you refer to the central concepts of your topic
- examples of ambiguity in student writing
	- > In Kjeldgaard-Christiansen's view, "technical agency allows for the experience of gratifying psychological agency in the virtual world". In other words, being able to act freely in a video game will lead to a feeling of autonomy and significance, which people find pleasurable."
		- What terms in the second sentence aim to explain the terms "experience" and "psychological agency" in the first sentence? The reader would need to do less mental work if they writer explicitly connected the concepts to the language in the second sentence, such as "In other words, players experience psychology agency when they are able to act freely in a video game, and this experience is gratifying in giving players the pleasurable feeling of autonomy and significance."
	- > To add to the academic conversation, Varella et al. discuss the evolution of artisticality through female intrasexual competition. They reviewed empirical evidence on the sex differences in artisticality and determined that women have a greater proclivity towards the arts than men.
		- How does the phrase "female intrasexual competition" in the first sentence relate to the second sentence phrase "women have a greater proclivity towards the arts than men"? Are these two ways of referring to the same thing or not?
	- > Credible signaling relates to the practice of coordinated musical behaviors for the purpose of social bonding. One scenario that illustrates this relationship is alliance formation or between-group cooperation."
		- The phrases "social bonding", "alliance formation," and "between-group cooperation" are similar, but are they different ways of referring to the same concept, or are different terms being used to draw attention to distinctions between them?
