There are several grammar issues commonly faced by native Chinese speakers when writing English (although native English speakers make these mistakes also!). Here are resources for learning to overcome these issues:

- read this useful handout about [Common English mistakes made by native Chinese speakers](/downloads/chinese-english-mistakes.pdf)
- articles (the, an, a): [How to Use Articles (a/an/the) - Purdue OWL®](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/using_articles.html)
- subject/verb agreement: [Subject/Verb Agreement - Purdue OWL®](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/subject_verb_agreement.html)
- verb tense: [Introduction to Verb Tenses - Purdue OWL®](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/verb_tenses/index.html)
	- NOTE:
		- when writing about source claims, use present tense (e.g.: Boyd states, Pinker notes, Dutton argues)
		- when writing about things that the source refers to as happening in the past, follow the source and use past tense (e.g.: According to Boyd, subjects in the dictator game *divided* the money...)
- plurals: I wasn't able to find any non-basic resources for avoiding mistakes with English plurals; please send me any you have found

If you have questions about any of this, please ask and I'll help you.
