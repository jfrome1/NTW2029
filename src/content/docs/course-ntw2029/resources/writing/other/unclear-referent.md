title: Unclear referents and ambiguous pronouns

Pronouns cause confusion when it's not clear what they refer to. There are two common versions of this problem, which I refer to by these labels:

### Unclear referents

Here, writers use a pronoun to refer to a concept or idea that is clear in their minds, but isn't specified in what's written, causing reader confusion. Most frequently, the pronoun's referent is unclear when the writer uses "this" or "it" alone as the subject of a sentence: "Students often write late into the night, and their memory can play tricks on them if they haven't slept and try to use energy drinks as stimulants. This has been studied by the Singapore Health Authority." What does "this" refer to? Your reader can't tell. So be clear: "The effect of energy drinks on memory has been studied..."

> The novel usually ends with good triumphing over evil, which provides readers with a sense of closure. This is contrary to what we experience in the real world, where there are several factors to consider. This makes it difficult to establish what is good and what is bad. Hence, by reading detective fiction, we are able to find solace in this alternate universe's stability, which is difficult to experience in real life.

What does the "this" starting the second sentence refer to, exactly? How about the "this" starting the third sentence?

As arguments become more complicated, it is increasingly important to be very clear and specific in your writing.

### Ambiguous pronoun

Here, a pronoun has several potential referents and the reader can't tell which one the writer is referring to.

> Puzzlingly, despite horror films evoking strong negative emotions, humans still take pleasure in horror experiences and they remain extremely popular, even in mainstream media.

With some mental effort, the reader can tell from context that the "they" in "they remain" refers to horror films, but grammatically, "they" could also refer to negative emotions, humans, or experiences.
