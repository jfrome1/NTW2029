In class, we ask questions to better understand the readings. Here is a longer list of questions you can use te practice this skill on your own.

## Questions to ask about your source

- What academic conversation is the source trying to contribute to?
- What is the thesis?
- What are the key terms and concepts used in the source?
- How clearly are the key terms defined?
- In simple terms, what seems to be motivating the source? What are they trying to do? What (if anything) do they think is wrong with what other have said?
- What does the source claim to contribute to the conversation? (It may be more than one of the following)
	- Synthesize and review existing sources
	- Fill a research gap (and what is that gap?)
	- Establish that a phenomenon exists
	- Provide details about a known phenomenon
	- Show a cause-effect relationship
	- Show that existing explanations of something are wrong
	- Propose a new framework for understanding something (what is new about it? What is wrong with existing explanations?)
- What is the significance (claimed and actual) of the source's contribution?
- What explicit or implicit assumptions does the source make?
- What alternative theories does the source consider, if any?
- If the source criticizes other theories, how does their theory avoid those criticisms?
- What counterarguments does the source consider (if any), and does the source respond to them effectively?

## Questions to ask about theoretical research

- How are the claims primarily supported? (Direct data, cited empirical research, cited theoretical research, illustrative examples, general reasoning)
- Are all parts of the thesis well-supported?
- What parts of the argument are original contributions and what parts are cited from others?
- What are the central examples of the phenomenon the source uses?
- How well does the explanation work for other types of examples?

## Questions to ask about empirical research

- What are the hypotheses?
- How are those hypotheses justified?
- Can you imagine equally strong justification for opposite hypotheses?
- What is the study methodology?
- What does the source claim the data shows?
- Are there confounding variables? (I.e. Factors that could have caused the results other than what the experiment varied)
- Are there possible explanations for the results other than the ones the source proposed?
- Are the stimuli studied representative of the larger phenomena the sources is aiming to explain? (E.g., if they are trying to study music, how typical is the music they use in the study?)
- How generalizable are the findings?
