This page provides grammar and style information that I can quickly refer to when providing feedback.

Some of the linked resources are full of pop-up ads. You may want to get [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to avoid those.

Khan Academy has a free course on [grammar](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/grammar) that lets you review rules and test yourself on various aspects of grammar (you can jump around; you don't need to take the whole course). Take advantage of it.

## Abstract nouns

Academic writing frequently uses abstract nouns, which can be grammatically tricky. Resources for dealing with abstract nouns include:

- [Grammarly blog: Abstract nouns](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/abstract-nouns/)
- [Scribbr: Abstract Noun | Definition, Examples & Worksheet](https://www.scribbr.com/nouns-and-pronouns/abstract-noun/)

## "As" for causality

Avoid using the word "as" to indicate cause-effect, e.g. "humans evolved to like fruit as eating fruit is fitness-enhancing". I suggest avoiding this use because "as" can be ambiguous. "As" can mean both "because" and "at the same time as". Consider " "animals run as they are in danger". Does this mean "animals run because they are in danger" or "animals run during times they are in danger"?

If you want to describe a cause-effect relationship, use words like "because", [:"since"](#x-since), or "due to".

## Commas

Review basic comma rules here: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/punctuation/commas/extended_rules_for_commas.html

Don't use a comma to indicate where you would pause if reading a sentence out loud. That's not what commas are for; they have other functions.

There's no shame in misusing commas because no one ever taught you how to use them, but you now have some resources and can ask me to clarify any rules you don't understand. If you want to use commas properly,  invest the time to learn the rules.

<!-- **Commas and compound predicates**

It's usually better to avoid a comma in a sentence with a compound predicate. See the explanation here: https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/09/comma-usage-and-compound-predicates.html and this article for a more in-depth discussion: https://cmosshoptalk.com/2021/01/19/commas-between-compound-predicates/

Avoid: "Pinker states that art is a byproduct, and argues that those who think is art is an adaptation are wrong."

Better: "Pinker states that art is a byproduct and argues that those who think is art is an adaptation are wrong." -->

## Dashes

Avoid using dashes (aka "em-dashes") in academic writing. Although they are fine in notes and informal writing, they are generally not used in formal writing, are rarely needed, and can create confusion if not used carefully.

Avoid: "Boyd argues that stories can not only help cooperation--they also aid the storyteller."

Better: "Boyd argues that stories can not only help cooperation; they can also aid the storyteller."

## Empty phrases

Try to avoid phrases that add little content to the paper,  such as "in his writing", "we should also note that", and "is it important to mention". Removing empty phrases makes the paper much more engaging and powerful.

## Oxford comma (aka serial comma)

In this course, please always use an Oxford comma (aka serial comma) in lists to prevent confusion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma

## Paramedic method (X does Y)

This sentence is not in "X does Y" form and might be hard for your generalist reader to parse. Consider using the Paramedic Method to revise: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paramedic_method.html

## Restrictive vs non-restrictive clauses

See [that vs which](#that-vs-which).

## Subject-pronoun agreement

The subject and the pronoun do not agree in number. Agreement can be trickier if your subject is an abstract noun (see above), but this is a basic rule of grammar and must be mastered, as these types of errors (fairly or unfairly) act as a key indicator of overall language fluency. Review the first point in this article: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/pronouns/index.html

## Subject-verb agreement

Subject and verb must agree (e.g. I _am_, she _is_, we _are_). Agreement can be trickier if your subject is an [:abstract noun](#abstract-nouns), but this is a basic rule of grammar and must be mastered, as these types of errors (fairly or unfairly) act as a key indicator of overall language fluency. Student errors in subject-verb agreement occur more frequently when a modifier makes a singular noun sound plural or vice-versa (e.g. "the brain's capacity to remember places and names" is singular, not plural). Review the rules in this article:  https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/subject_verb_agreement.html

## Verb tense for source actions (e.g. says, writes, argues)

Follow these rules for verb tense when writing about source claims, as they match our approach of thinking about writing as an academic conversation. When writing, pretend that anything written in the source is something that they are actually saying to you directly as you read it. Thus:

- when writing about source claims, use present tense (e.g.: Boyd states, Pinker notes, Dutton argues)
- when writing about things that the source refers to as happening in the past, follow the source and use past tense (e.g.: According to Boyd, subjects in the dictator game *divided* the money...)

There are disciplinary differences and exceptions, but we'll keep it simple in this course where possible

## That vs which

Review the rules for using the words "that" vs "which" here: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/that_vs_which.html

## Unclear referent

See [Unclear referents and ambiguous pronouns](/course-ntw2029/resources/unclear-referent)

##### :x since

Technically, "since" can also indicate either cause-effect or something about time, but this ambiguity is rarely a problem.
