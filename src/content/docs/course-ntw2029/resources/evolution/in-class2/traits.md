- individual organisms have traits (i.e., characteristics)
- when individuals that make up that species regularly have a trait across generations, we say the species has that trait
- in simple terms, we think of traits as caused by genes (or DNA), which provide a "blueprint" for building an organism with certain traits
	- genotype: genetic characteristics/DNA/"blueprint"
	- phenotype: observable characteristics or traits
- traits include not just aspects of an organism's body but also its behavior
	- animal e.g.s
		- Spiders build webs
		- Bees build hives
		- Caterpillars build cocoons and become butterflies
- innate traits
	- innate doesn't mean present at birth
	- innate doesn't mean exists in every member of a species without exception
	- innate means develops in members of a species in normal circumstances
	- e.g. ability to see colors, ability to walk, male facial hair post-puberty
