- sexual selection theory was developed to solve a problem facing evolutionary theory: traits that seem to hurt an organism's ability to survive, such as the peacock's tail, don't seem to match this theory of natural selection
- types of sexual selection
	- intra-sexual competition / win access to females
		- males fight and the winner gets to mate with all/most fertile females
	- attraction / encourage partners to choose them
		- for most animals, the females choose males to mate with and males are happy to mate with any females that choose them
