title: Evolution Resources
---

Here are additional resources to learn about evolution. Some provide further explanation and examples to help you get more comfortable with class concepts. Others give information on issues we don't have time to discuss in class and allow you to dig deeper to answer questions you might have.

Please use the right sidebar or search bar to quickly find relevant resources. If you have any suggestions for additions to these resources, please send me a link.

## Evolution—Is it really true?

## Isn't Evolution just a theory, not a fact?

- When speaking formally, science uses the word "theory" differently than in common usage. There is the "germ theory of disease", but no one says, "aren't germs just a theory, not a fact?"
- a good written explanation of what "theory" and "law" mean in science vs. ordinary language
