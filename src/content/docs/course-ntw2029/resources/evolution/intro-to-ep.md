- psychology: study of human thoughts and behavior (i.e., the human mind)
- EP is a combination of cognitive science and evolutionary biology
	- cog sci key idea: the mind is created by the complex structure of the brain
	- evolution key idea: the brain's structure evolved due to natural selection
- EEA: Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (or Adaptation)
	- EPs call the time and setting in which humans evolved the EEA
	- evolution is very slow, so we would expect human traits to be adapted to the EEA rather than our modern society
	- EP can be briefly summarized as the notion that modern humans have "stone-age" minds adapted for the EEA rather than for modern circumstances
	- [What Happened Before History? Human Origins YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGiQaabX3_o) (first 6 min)
- EP summary:
	- Animals evolved many traits that humans also have, such as bones and eyes, over the billions of years before EEA
	- Human-like ancestors (members of genus Homo) appeared around 2.5 million years ago (MYA) at the beginning of the EEA.
	- During the EEA, we evolved our uniquely human traits, including our language abilities and unique aspects of our brain structure.
	- We reached our biologically modern form around 200k years ago and have (mostly) the same biology today, including brain structures that influence our behavior.
	- Some aspects of modern behavior are the result of our evolved brain structure, and thus are likely adapted to the EEA rather than to modern society
- why is EP appealing?
	- seems to explain behaviors that are otherwise hard to explain
		- overeating
		- celebrity obsession

I don't have any good videos introducing EP. If you find any, please send them to me!
