Below are common questions asked about evolution and resources answering those questions.

### Is there actually evidence showing evolution is true?

Evolution is supported by overwhelming evidence from several scientific fields. It's as well-established as the theory of gravity or the germ theory of disease.

### Isn't evolution just a theory, not a fact?

Science uses the word "theory" differently than we do when speaking in ordinary language. In science, "theory" means a well-substantiated explanation supported by evidence, not a guess. Evolution is both a fact (it happens) and a theory (explaining how it happens). Note that you rarely hear anyone say, "isn't gravity just a theory, not a fact?"

### Has evolution ever actually been observed?

Yes, we've directly observed evolution in lab experiments and in nature, including observing new species forming.

### Why haven't we seen intermediate fossils?

We actually have seen many transitional fossils—fish with limb-like fins, feathered dinosaurs, early humans with ape-like features.

### If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?

We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and modern monkeys share a common ancestor, but it was not identical to either species.

### How do we really know that modern species branched off from earlier species and that we shared ancestors with other species?

We have found identical segments of DNA in very different species. This finding makes perfect sense if these species shared a common ancestor, but it's very hard to explain this match if they didn't.

	- _This fairly technical video provides compelling evidence that humans and chimps share a common ancestor._

### When was the first chicken/dog/bird/human?

There wasn't a "first" of any species. Each generation looks almost identical to its parents, and tiny variations in traits have to accumulate over thousands of generations for a new species to form. The transition from one species to another is thus very gradual, but we have to talk as if there is a clear line between species to discuss evolutionary concepts.

	- _This discussion of the first human helps explain the concept of speciation and species more broadly_
- [Which Came First - The Chicken or the Egg?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8pI65emDE)
	- "It has perplexed humanity from as early as the Ancient Greeks. So which came first, the chicken or the egg? We take a crack at this curious conundrum."

### Are humans still evolving?

Yes, humans are still evolving, and we can see various trait changes in different human populations. However, these trait changes haven't cause humans to branch off into different species, and our ability to change our environments and potentially our own genetics means that evolutionary concepts don't apply neatly or reliably to modern humans.

### Are evolution and religion compatible?

Many religious people accept evolution as an explanation of how biological diversity developed. For more, see resource page `Evolution and Religion`.

### If evolution is random, how can species be so perfectly designed?

Mutations are random, but natural selection isn't—it consistently preserves helpful traits. And species aren't perfectly designed; they're full of evolutionary compromises and leftover quirks.

### If evolution works through tiny changes, how can something complex like an eye evolve? An eye requires lots of different parts to work together, so a tiny change creating one part of an eye wouldn't be useful and wouldn't be reproduced.

Parts of eyes are each useful on their own--even a simple light-sensitive patch helps organisms detect shadows and avoid predators, which is useful. The complex interactions in the modern eye evolved through several smaller changes (curved shape to detect direction, pinhole for sharper image, lens for focus) that each provided immediate benefits and spread through populations.

### Doesn't evolution violate the second law of thermodynamics, which says systems tend to become more chaotic rather than more organized?

No, the second law only says closed systems become more disordered, but Earth isn't closed—we get constant energy from the sun. Life can become more complex because it uses energy to create local order while increasing disorder elsewhere.
