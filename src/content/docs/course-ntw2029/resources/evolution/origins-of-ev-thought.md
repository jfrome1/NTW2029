- questions that led to evolutionary theory
	- why is there such diversity of life (DOL) in the world (i.e. so many kinds of plants and animals)?
	- why do species seem so well-matched with their environments, as if designed for those environments?
- what is a species?
	- informal definition: a group or type of plant or animal, like palm tree, tiger, rabbit, sunflower, human
	- formal definition: a group of organisms that can breed with each other but cannot breed with others outside the group
- 1st explanation for DOL (pre-1700s): God created all species in their current forms and they are well-matched to their environments due to God's plan
- fossils
	- preserved remains of long-dead organisms
	- study of fossils in 1700s began to change views of species
	- belief developed that fossils showed extinct species that were compared to modern species
	- led to new view that species might develop or change over long periods of time
- Darwin and evolution
	- Darwin's first book is _On the Origin of Species_ and aimed to explain DOL
	- note, it was not _How Life Began_, and didn't try to explain how life started
	- the concept that species evolved existed before Darwin
	- Darwin's most important contribution was proposing a mechanism that could explain the DOL and the apparent "design" of animals with a naturalistic (non-supernatural) explanation called "natural selection"
	- i.e., Darwin showed how a non-thinking process could produce something that seemed to require design (will be explained in videos for 1.2)
- "tree of life"
	- some who accepted the basic concept of evolution thought that God initially created a wide variety of species, and these species evolved over time
	- Darwin's new idea as that all modern species branched off from a very small number of earlier species, maybe even just one
		- e.g., Darwin proposed that four species of finches on nearby islands were similar to each other because they all branched off from one earlier species of finch, and were different from each other because the four populations were separated and evolved in different ways
- evolutionary theory had nothing to do with religion
	- the belief that God created species is compatible with the general idea that species can change over time
	- the notion that evolution might be incompatible with religion is a more modern view
	- Darwin's goal was to explain observations about the animal world, not to make a social theory or a point about religion
	- views that evolution is incompatible with religion are based on very literal readings of religious texts; e.g. the notion that humans evolved from other species is incompatible with a view that humans were literally created out of dirt or clay

- Article: [Was Charles Darwin an Atheist?](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/was-charles-darwin-an-atheist)
	- According to this article, Darwin was born a Christian, but "[a] gradual scepticism towards Christianity and the authenticity of the Bible gradually crept over him during the late 1830s — leaving him not a Christian, but no atheist either; rather a sort of theist. To be a 'theist' in Darwin's day was to believe that a supernatural deity had created nature or the universe but did not intervene in the course of history."
