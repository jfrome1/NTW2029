- terminology
	- genotype: genetic characteristics/DNA/blueprint
	- phenotype: observable characteristics or traits
		- examples?
	- term "natural selection"
		- there are mechanisms that affect evolution that we won't discuss due to time or complexity (e.g. genetic drift)
		- some biologists group all of these mechanisms under the term "natural selection" and consider sexual selection to be one of many mechanisms that are part of natural selection
			- this is the way I use the term when I talk about "Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection" in a general sense
		- other biologists think of "natural selection" as meaning the mechanism by which organisms acquire traits that aid survival, and sexual selection as the mechanism by which organisms acquire traits that aid reproductionâ€”this is the way I use the terms in this class when talking about the specific mechanisms of natural vs. sexual selection
			- sometimes "natural selection" used in this sense is called "survival selection"
	- term "reproductive fitness"
		- means "likelihood of passing genes through the next generations"
		- does not mean "overall health and fitness" or "physical attractiveness"
		- must get totally comfortable with this concept
- natural selection
	- natural selection is a mechanism causing species' traits to change over time
		- note: not individual organism's traits, but the constantly-changing population of organisms that make up a species
	- natural selection is explained as a consequence of three facts
		1. organisms (members of a species) vary in their traits
		2. not all members of a species reproduce due to selection pressure (such as limited food)
		3. those who reproduce pass their traits to their children, the next generation, by passing on their genes, including genes responsible for their particular variety of traits
	- powerpoint explanation:
		- [berries.pptx](/downloads/evolution-berries.pptx)
	- note that all traits must be adaptations, byproducts, or vestigial/disappearing
		- adaptations: traits that increase reproductive fitness
			- adaptations are not traits that are useful in every situation, but increase fitness *on average, across the population*
			- e.g. thirst in lifeboat
		- byproducts: traits that continue not due to their effect on reproductive fitness, but because they are side-effects of adaptations
		- vestigial/disappearing: traits that are no longer adaptive, have some cost, and thus are selected against
		- why are all traits in one of these categories?
			- A characteristic trait of a species continues through generations, according to evolutionary theory, because it is fitness-enhancing (adaptation), is connected to a fitness-enhancing trait (byproduct). Any other trait that appeared in an organism that wasn't vestigial/disappearing would be temporary. It wouldn't continue through generations and thus wouldn't be a trait of the species.
