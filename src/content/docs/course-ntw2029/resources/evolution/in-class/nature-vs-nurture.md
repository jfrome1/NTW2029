- a small number of human traits are determined by genes alone
	- a few by one gene
		- detached earlobes vs. attached earlobes
		- presence or absence of a widow's peak
		- dry vs wet earwax
	- a few others are by several genes
		- blood type
		- eye color
- but most bodily and behavioral traits are determined by the interaction of many genes and the environment rather than by genes alone
	- e.g. ancient dry seeds sprout when planted in soil
	- e.g. height is determined mostly by genes, but also by environment (e.g., malnutrition)

	- vision might seem wholly genetic, but raising an animal in darkness usually causes blindness

- good to recognize that traits are not cause by just nature or just nurture, but shouldn't stop the conversation there
	- we should not stop the discussion at the idea that both nature/genetics and nurture/environment are important
	- research tries to be more specific about the ways that genetics and environment interact in terms of determining an organism's traits
- nature vs. nurture: think 'environmental variation within genetic range'
	- nature/genetics/biology: sets trait parameters (range of possible outcomes)
	- nurture/environment: determines how traits actually develop within those parameters
	- e.g. height
		- a tree may have the genetic potential to grow up to 10 meters tall
		- how tall it actually grows is determined by environmentâ€”soil quality, amount of sun, amount of rain
		- malnutrition prevents maximum height, but good nutrition won't make the tree 500 meters tall
		- in other words, environment determines traits within biological parameters
