title: Gene's eye view and altruism (1.2)

- natural and sexual selection explain why species have traits that increase their chances of reproduction, but they could not explain one type of behavioral trait: biological altruism
		- in ordinary language, "altruism" means helping others at some cost to yourself (even if the cost is just your time or attention)
	- we think of altruism as something motivated by morality, a positive human nature, or a good upbringing
	- in evolution, "altruism" means increasing another organism's reproductive fitness (i.e., their likelihood of passing on their genes) at a cost to your own

	- animal e.g.s
		- bees sacrifice themselves for the hive
		- bats share blood with other bats who didn't get any
		- prairie dog alarm calls

- the gene's eye view theory was developed to explain biological altruism, which seems to hurt an organism's reproductive fitness
	- the theory says that we should look at reproductive fitness not at the level of individual organisms, but at the level of genes
	- on this view, genes cause organisms to act in ways that maximize copies of those genes, and by causing organisms to act altruistically, genes increase the chance that copies of the genes that exist in other organisms will be passed on
		- this is why the theory is sometimes called "the selfish gene" theory; the gene cares about reproducing itself even if it means one individual organism carrying it might die
		- of course, this is figurative language, since genes don't have minds and can't actually care about anything
	- we don't call the theory "the selfish gene" theory (and its creator regrets the calling it that) because the theory doesn't explain selfish behavior of organisms, but its opposite, altruistic behavior!

	- this theory also explains why biological altruism typically correlates with genetic relatedness (i.e. the more shared genes, the more altruistic the behavior)
	- altruism can spread if "altruism genes" (just an analogy) help other organisms with "altruism genes", increasing the number of those genes in the population that makes up a species
