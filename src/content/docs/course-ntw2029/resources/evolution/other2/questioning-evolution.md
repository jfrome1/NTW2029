Below are common questions asked by people who have been encouraged to be skeptical of evolution (which is totally fine) and resources answering those questions.

## Evolution—Is it really true?

- [Evolution: It's a Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3GagfbA2vo)
- [Myths and misconceptions about evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZt1Gn0R22Q&list=PLD018AC9B25A23E16&index=80)

## Isn't evolution just a theory, not a fact?

- When speaking formally, science uses the word "theory" differently than in common usage. There is the "germ theory of disease", but no one says, "aren't germs just a theory, not a fact?"
- a good written explanation of what "theory" and "law" mean in science vs. ordinary language

## Has evolution ever actually been observed?

## Why haven't we seen intermediate fossils?

- [Richard Dawkins: Show me the intermediate fossils!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o92x6AvxCFg)

## If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?

- [Richard Dawkins: Why are there still Chimpanzees?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0F4FBLJRE)

- [Does evolution violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics?](https://youtu.be/c_jyHp3bmEw?t=577)

## How do we really know that modern species branched off from earlier species and that we shared ancestors with other species?

- [Proof of Evolution Is Hiding in Your DNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GfKZlTRNjA&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-rZTTXNXuL07poGP5B6TKKu&index=54)
- [DNA Evidence That Humans & Chimps Share A Common Ancestor: Endogenous Retroviruses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXfDF5Ew3Gc) (13 min)
	- _This fairly technical video provides compelling evidence that humans and chimps share a common ancestor._

## When was the first chicken/dog/bird/human?

- [There Was No First Human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdWLhXi24Mo)
	- _This discussion of the first human helps explain the concept of speciation and species more broadly_
- [Which Came First - The Chicken or the Egg?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8pI65emDE)
	- "It has perplexed humanity from as early as the Ancient Greeks. So which came first, the chicken or the egg? We take a crack at this curious conundrum."

## Are humans still evolving?

## Are evolution and religion compatible?

See [Evolution and Religion](/course-ntw2029/resources/evolution/other/ev-religion).

## If evolution is random, how can species be so perfectly designed?
