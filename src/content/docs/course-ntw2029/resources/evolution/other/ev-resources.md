## Simulating evolution

This web series uses computer simulations to explore many interesting ideas about evolution. Learning through these simulations is a different type of experience.

Below are a few example videos. The whole evolution playlist is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDvzbBRiNlA&list=PLKortajF2dPBWMIS6KF4RLtQiG6KQrTdB).

- [Simulating Natural Selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM)
- [Simulating the Evolution of Aggression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNMkADpvO4w)
- [Simulating Green Beard Altruism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goePYJ74Ydg)

## Epigenitics

- [Is Epigenetic Inheritance Real?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81rFpRsF80c&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-rZTTXNXuL07poGP5B6TKKu&index=101)

## Human sexual selection

- [Are Short Men at a Disadvantage in Romance?](http://youtu.be/AR3YR1ZTonc)
		- _The bit at the very end that is hard to hear is a woman saying "I guess the only thing you could say is that the other four are criminals [or something like that]." You can then hear in the background another woman saying "psychotic"!_
- [Will Dancing Get You Laid?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqx0-ol5qeQ)

## Useful YouTube channels

- [Stated Clearly](https://www.youtube.com/user/sciencestatedclearly)
- [Genetics & Evolution Stated Casually](https://www.youtube.com/c/StatedCasually) — more content from the "Stated Clearly" creator
- [Be Smart](https://www.youtube.com/user/itsokaytobesmart) — general science channel with many videos relevant to evolution
- The channel [Primer](https://www.youtube.com/c/PrimerLearning) has a good [playlist about evolution](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKortajF2dPBWMIS6KF4RLtQiG6KQrTdB) with a focus on demonstrating principles using computer simulations; these are more mathematically complex than the other channels but are valuable even if you don't follow the equations.
- [Understanding genetics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJicmE8fK0EiuxzIxoeC7R3-EFUrtaf9t) — TedEd playlist covering many interesting topics in genetics
