## How Academic Citation Works

Academic citation requires two interconnected components:

1. **In-text citations** - Brief parenthetical notes showing where you use sources
2. **Reference list** - Full publication details for every source cited

Every in-text citation must match a reference list entry. Don't include any sources in your reference list that aren't cited in-text. <span class="smaller-text"> [:Why not include all references you looked at?](#x-why-not-include-all-references-you-looked-at) </span>

The citation guidelines on this page are a slightly simplified version of APA (American Psychological Association) rules.

## Part 1: In-Text Citations

### Core Principle

Tell the reader where you got any source ideas or quotes by citing the location in your text with (Author, Year, Page). But omit the information that's already obvious to the reader.

### Quick Reference Table

| Situation | Citation Format |
|-----------|----------------|
| First mention of a source and author| Either _According to Pinker (2002)... (405)_ or _People seem to... (Pinker, 2002, 405)_ |
| Author named in the sentence, year not yet given | _Pinker (2002) argues... (405)_ |
| Source year already given, author obvious | _He also argues... (405)_ |
| Same source, same paragraph | _(407)_ [just the page number] |
| Two authors | _(Boyd & Richerson, 1985, 23)_ |
| Three+ authors | _(Savage et al., 2021, 15)_ |

**Key rules**:

- Page number almost always required <span class="smaller-text"> [:When is page number not required?](#x-when-is-page-number-not-required)  </span>
- Period goes after closing parenthesis
- No "p." before page numbers

## Part 2: Reference List

### Essential Formats

| Source Type | Format Pattern |
|------------|----------------|
| **Journal article** | Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Article title lowercase. _Journal Name_, _volume_(issue), pages. DOI |
| **Book** | Author, A. A. (Year). _Book title: Subtitle lowercase_. Publisher. DOI [if it has one] |
| **Book chapter in single author book** | cite the whole book as shown above |
| **Book chapter in edited collection (editor + multiple authors)** | Author, A. A. (Year). Chapter title lowercase. In E. E. Editor (Ed.), _Book title_ (pp. xx-xx). Publisher. DOI [if it has one] |

### Real Examples

**Journal article:**

Savage, P. E., Loui, P., Tarr, B., Schachner, A., Glowacki, L., Mithen, S., & Fitch, W. T. (2021). Music as a coevolved system for social bonding. _Behavioral and Brain Sciences_, 44, e59. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20000333

**Book:**

Pinker, S. (2002). _The blank slate: The modern denial of human nature_. Viking.

**Book chapter in edited collection:**

### Formatting Your Reference List

Look at the paper template to quickly see proper reference list formatting. [:Proper formatting example](#x-proper-formatting-example)

Do:
- Alphabetical order by first author's last name
- Hanging indent (first line at page margin, following lines indented)
- Include DOI or publisher URL where available
- Italics for journal and book titles
- No extra lines between entries

Don't:
- Never include page numbers for whole books
- Never use database URLs (JSTOR, ProQuest) or repository URLs (ssrn.org, academia.edu)
- Never add quotation marks around article titles

## When Citation Is Required

**You must cite:**

- Paraphrases and summaries of others' ideas (not just direct quotes)
- Specific facts, statistics, or findings
- Any ideas that aren't your own original analysis

**You don't cite:**

- Common knowledge (e.g. "video games require skill", "there are thousands of species")
- Unsourced ideas from class discussion
- Ideas I gave you during conferences
- Your own arguments and analysis

## FAQs

### Can you double-check my citations?

I'm happy to answer specific questions about unusual sources or citation situations, but please don't send me your reference list just to check it (you're asking me to copyedit your work). I'm also happy to look at reference lists in person to see if anything looks wrong to me at first glance, but I can't confirm the citation information is correct unless I look up the source using my computer.

### How are your citation rules different from standard APA?

There is a really minor difference I didn't want to burden you with: standard APA tells you to include the year after an author's name every time you start a new paragraph.

### When do I need to cite sources?

You need to cite every time you use others' ideas, whether you quote or paraphrase. Two exceptions: common knowledge and information from class. Failure to cite can have serious consequences, unintentional or not.

### How often should I include in-text citations?

Have at least one in-text citation in each paragraph that uses a source's ideas, and include a new citation if the relevant page changes. I need enough information to find the location you're discussing.

##### :x when is page number not required

If you are not telling the reader where you got an idea or quote, but are instead pointing to the entire source as an example of something, you don't include a page number; e.g.:

> _Some scholars argue that art is adaptive due to cooperation (Boyd 2002, Austin 2010)._

##### :x why not include all references you looked at

Some reference lists include all works read or consulted in writing a paper, but here we list only references actually cited in your essay.

##### :x detailed examples showing the redundancy principle

The redundancy removal principle in action:

**First citation:**
>
> _According to evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker (2002), art serves no adaptive function (405)._

We name the author in text, so the parentheses only need year and page. We don't repeat "Pinker" in the in-text citation. [:Why isn't the year in the citation?](#x-why-isnt-the-year-in-the-citation)

**Next sentence, same source:**

>
> _He argues that art is merely a byproduct of other evolved capacities (407)._

Just page number - reader knows we're still discussing Pinker (2002).

**New paragraph, same source:**
>
> _Pinker's byproduct hypothesis has three components (410)._

Remind reader of author, but year unnecessary unless you are citing multiple Pinker sources and need to make clear which one you're referring to.

##### :x why isnt the year in the citation

If the first time you mention a source's authors is in a sentence, you put the year directly after the author's name, but if it's in an in-text citation, you put it in the citation. e.g.:

> _According to Pinker (2002), musical structure mirrors the structure of language (405)._

vs.

> _Musical structure mirrors the structure of language (Pinker, 2002, 405)._

##### :x how to find dois and official urls

**Finding DOIs for journal articles:**

1. Go to the NUS library website, login
2. Search for the article title in quotes
3. Click "View Online" or "Get Full Text"
4. On the publisher's page, find the DOI (usually near the title)
5. Copy entire DOI including https://doi.org/ prefix

**If article has no DOI:**

- Use stable publisher URL (not PDF link)
- Never use: Google Scholar links, download URLs, database links

**For books:**

- Physical books: just publisher name, no URL
- E-books: include DOI or publisher URL if available

##### :x examples of common knowledge vs citable claims

**Common knowledge (no citation needed):**

- _Many people enjoy music._
- _People dance to celebrate._
- _The human brain has two hemispheres._
- _Darwin created a theory of evolution by natural selection._

**Requires citation:**

- _Music appears in all known cultures (Savage et al., 2021, 1)_
- _The brain's default mode network activates during rest (Raichle, 2015, 47)_
- _The earliest wind instrument ever found, a flute, is over 8,000 years old (Author, 2020, 23)_

Rule: If a reasonable person would need to verify it, cite it.

##### :x citation mistakes and how to avoid them

**Copy-paste formatting problems:**
When you copy from Word/Google Docs/websites, invisible formatting tags come too. This can cause mixed fonts, extra spacing, and other errors.

Solution: Paste as plain text (Ctrl+Shift+V), then reformat.

**Citation generator errors:**

If citation generators worked well, I'd recommend them, but they don't. They often get information and formatting wrong.

Solution: Verify citations against official sources, such as the journal's official online page.

**Course citations are wrong:**

I sometimes write things like "Pinker Ch. 8" or "Boyd (51-55)" for teaching purposes. Your citations should follow standard format.

Solution: Don't try to save ten seconds by copying the course citations, find the official versions.

**Missing page numbers:**

Many students think page numbers are only needed for direct quotes, but that's not the case.

Solution: Cite page numbers in text whenever discussing claims or evidence from particular places in your sources.

##### :x practice examples

Test yourself! Try to identify all errors in each item before expanding to see the answers:

<details><summary>In-text: According to Pinker in 2002, art is evolutionarily useless (Pinker, 2002, p. 405).</summary>

Errors:

- Year should be in parentheses after name: Pinker (2002)
- Don't repeat author name in parenthetical citation
- Don't use "p." before page number
- Correct: According to Pinker (2002), art is evolutionarily useless (405).

</details>

<details><summary>Reference: Dutton, D. (2009). "The Art Instinct: Beauty, Pleasure, and Human Evolution." Bloomsbury Press.</summary>

Errors:

- No quotation marks around book title
- Book title should be italicized
- Capitalize only first word of title/subtitle
- Correct: Dutton, D. (2009). _The art instinct: Beauty, pleasure, and human evolution_. Bloomsbury Press.

</details>

<details><summary>In-text: Savage et al. (2021) argues that music bonds groups (15).</summary>

Error:

- Very subtle error! "Savage et al." is plural because it refers to multiple authors, so the verb must be plural also: "argue", not "argues"
- Correct: Savage et al. (2021) argue that music bonds groups (15).

</details>

##### :x why simplified

Standard APA requires the year every time you start a new paragraph, even if you're still discussing the same source. This creates unnecessary repetition that confuses students and clutters their writing.

Our simplified version follows a clearer principle: once you've identified a source, you don't need to keep re-identifying it unless there's potential confusion. This reduces errors while maintaining clarity about source attribution.

The difference:

- **Standard APA**: Pinker (2002) in every new paragraph
- **Simplified APA**: Pinker (2002) on first mention only

This simplification typically prevents 3-4 errors per paper. You'll need standard APA in other courses, but for this course, focus on the simplified version to ensure accuracy in the fundamentals.
