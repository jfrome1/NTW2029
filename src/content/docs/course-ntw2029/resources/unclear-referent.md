Try to follow this argument:

_The novel ends with a sense of closure for the reader as good triumphs over evil. This is contrary to what we experience in the real world, where situations often remain unresolved, and morals are often complex and dynamic. This makes it difficult to feel reassured about what will happen in the future. Thus, we enjoy reading detective fiction, Zunshine argues, because it provides a sense of stability in an alternate universe that is difficult to experience in real life._

Was it easy to follow the argument? Or did you pause when parsing the sentences starting with "This"? Readers have to figure out what "this" in the second sentence refers to. Is it the sense of closure? Good triumphing over evil? The entire concept? And the "this" in the third sentenceâ€”does it mean the unresolved situations, the complex and dynamic morals, or something else entirely?

Student authors know what they mean when they write "this is" or "it means", but readers are confused when it's not clear what those pronouns are referring to. [:See how clarifying the referents makes writing clearer](#x-See-how-clarifying-the-referents-makes-writing-clearer)

## Unclear referents

Writers often use pronouns like "this" or "it" to refer to ideas that are clear in their minds but are not explicitly stated for the reader.

**Example:**

_Students often write late into the night, and their memory can play tricks on them if they haven't slept and try to use energy drinks as stimulants. This has been studied by the Singapore Health Authority._

What has been studied? Late-night writing? Memory tricks? Sleep deprivation? Energy drinks? The combined effect? Your reader shouldn't have to guess.

**Fix:** Be explicit about what you're referring to:

_...energy drinks as stimulants. The effect of energy drinks on sleep-deprived memory has been studied by the Singapore Health Authority._

## Ambiguous pronouns: Too many options

Sometimes a pronoun could grammatically refer to multiple things in the sentence, leaving readers unsure which one you mean.

**Example:**

_Puzzlingly, despite horror films evoking strong negative emotions, horror audiences are growing in size and they remain extremely popular, even in mainstream media._

Does "they" refer to horror films, negative emotions, or horror audiences? Context suggests horror films, but there's no need to make your reader guess.

**Fix:** Repeat the noun or restructure:

_...horror audiences are growing in size and these films remain extremely popular, even in mainstream media._

## Recommendation

Before submitting any assignment, search for every "this," "it," "they," and "that" in your draft. Will the reader immediately know what it refers to? If not, revise to clarify the specific noun or phrase.

The example revised to make "this" clearer:

_The novel ends with a sense of closure for the reader as good triumphs over evil. This clear resolution is contrary to what we experience in the real world, where situations often remain unresolved and morals are often complex and dynamic. Reality's ever-changing moral landscape makes it difficult to feel reassured about what will happen in the future. Thus, we enjoy reading detective fiction, Zunshine argues, because it provides a sense of stability in an alternate universe that is difficult to experience in real life._
