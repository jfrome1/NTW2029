<!-- Paper 2 proposal -->

Assignment purpose:

- Although your paper will develop and change over time, it's best to propose a thesis early so you can figure out what will or won't work and so I can give you feedback.
- To successfully write Paper 2, your paper will analyze a specific part of your source's argument, which requires you to complete a number of tasks. Below I've listed these tasks to give you an overview of the process. This list is not what you need to do for this week's proposal assignment; I'm giving you this overview so you better understand how the proposal fits into the Paper 2 assignment as a whole.  The tasks are:
  - identify the academic conversation the source is aiming to participate in
  - understand the source's argument regarding this conversation ("they say")
  - summarize the source argument broadly in order to orient the reader to the specific part of the argument you want to challenge
  - summarize the specific part of the argument you want to analyze (this part doesn't have to be an individual claim, it can be a main point of the argument, or an idea or concept, or the significance of the argument, etc.)
  - analyze the argument to identify some way you can add to the conversation
  - make a claim (your thesis) evaluating, correcting, and/or extending about some specific and limited part of the source argument ("I say")
  - support your claim with reasoning (explanation and analysis) and evidence (quotations from and paraphrases of the source and/or from other sources)
  - explain why your thesis is significant to and/or adds to the academic conversation (note that I am not asking you to show that your challenge is significant to the world at large or to social policy or anything like that)
- Your proposal will be your next step towards these goals. Ignore any ideas you currently have about what counts as a paper proposal. Do not send a list of general notes and ideas about the source text. Distilling your notes and ideas into a focused proposal is a skill you must develop. You need to turn those notes into clear, concise answers to the below questions before submitting them to me.

Logistics:

- The proposal will consist of answers to the following questions, written in full sentences in a clear, formal style, submitted in the text box (no links to documents, please).
- Use your main source citation information as your proposal title (properly formatted as if in a reference list).
- Copy/paste these questions into your proposal and put your answers below each question:
  - 1. What is the academic conversation to which the source aims to contribute? Make sure to identify the phenomenon the conversation aims to explain and consider what your source says "they say". Be specific rather than general.
    - e.g. broad: "The source aims to contribute to the academic discussion about how music evolved in humans."
    - e.g. specific: "The source aims to contribute to the academic discussion about which of three specific theories best explains how music evolved in humans."
  - 2. What are the sources' main theses or conclusions that contribute to this academic conversation? (1-3 main claims only)
  - 3. Which one of these claims (or contributing sub-claim) do you plan to analyze? Pick a claim that seems incomplete, ambiguous, problematic, or limited in some way.
  - 4. Write a 250 word (max) summary of the argument the source uses to support the claim. Make sure the summary clearly connects the claim to the academic conversation.
  - 5. Identify the specific claim from your source that you plan to analyze and identify the reasons and evidence (if any) supporting the claim, as well as any important assumptions the claim relies on.
  - 5. If you can, suggest one or two possible ways you are thinking about evaluating, correcting, or extending the argument.
  - 6. If you can, suggest why your challenge might be significant to the academic conversation about this topic.
- We will discuss your proposal in individual conferences next week

Proposal red flags for "I say" / your thesis

- "I will show that X is not the only factor causing Y" (do they say it is? usually they don't)
- "They explain A, but not B, and I fill the gap by explaining B" (is B needed to support A or is it a separate topic/question? does the source intend to discuss B?)
- "Their theory doesn't fully/completely explain phenomenon C" (is their goal to do this? do your counterexamples actually undermine their argument or are you just focusing on a different thing?)
