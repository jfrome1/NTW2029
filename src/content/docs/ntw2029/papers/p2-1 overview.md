<!-- Paper 2 overview -->

Paper 2 goal: clearly explain and analyze a recent published academic argument about EP and art to your target audience.

- Note: the goal is NOT to answer a research question by synthesizing what other people have said; this course demands a more ambitious goal
- Note: the goal is NOT to try to answer a research question by proposing and defending your own theory about EP and art; that is overly ambitious and not realistic given the time limits and introductory nature of this class

A bit more detail on the paper goals:

<details><summary>explain and analyze...</summary>

- explain the source's attempted contribution to an ongoing academic conversanion
- analyze some specific aspect of that argument in a way that adds to the academic conversation by telling your reader what you think/how they should think about your source (and, optionally and if appropriate, a way the argument could be improved)
- even more detail: To successfully write Paper 2, your paper will analyze a specific part of your source's argument, which requires you to complete a number of tasks. Below I've listed these tasks to give you an overview of the process. The tasks are:
	- identify the academic conversation the source is aiming to participate in
	- understand the source's argument regarding this conversation ("they say")
	- summarize the source argument broadly in order to orient the reader to the specific part of the argument you want to challenge
	- summarize the specific part of the argument you want to analyze (this part doesn't have to be an individual claim, it can be a main point of the argument, or an idea or concept, or the significance of the argument, etc.)
	- analyze the argument to identify some way you can add to the conversation
	- make a claim (your thesis) evaluating, correcting, and/or extending about some specific and limited part of the source argument ("I say")
	- support your claim with reasoning (explanation and analysis) and evidence (quotations from and paraphrases of the source and/or from other sources)
	- explain why your thesis is significant to and/or adds to the academic conversation (note that I am not asking you to show that your challenge is significant to the world at large or to social policy or anything like that)

<details><summary>...a recent published academic argument...</summary>

- "recent" means within the last ten years (exceptions can be made, just ask, but at least try to find more recent rather than less)
- academic sources do not include personal webpages, Wikipedia, or most blogs (exceptions exist)
- academic sources include books and journals published by a university press or an academic press
- academic presses that are not university presses include:
	- Elsevier
	- Springer
	- Wiley-Blackwell
	- Taylor & Francis
	- Sage Publications
	- Palgrave Macmillan
	- Brill
	- Routledge
	- De Gruyter
	- Nature Publishing Group
	- PLOS (Public Library of Science)
	- The Royal Society

<details><summary>...to your target audience</summary>

- your target audience is an NUSC student without expertise in your topic

</details>

Logistics:

- paper should be 2500 words (+/10%), excluding reference list
- your specific paper topic and main source must be approved and finalized before the Paper 2 brief source summary due week 9
- your paper must use at least four academic sources
	- these include one primary source (the focus of your analysis) and three or more supporting sources
	- it is also ok to compare two primary sources and use two or more supporting sources
- you must submit all parts of the assignment to get credit for the paper
- late submission of any part may affect your grade up to 1/3 letter grade per day late

Paper 2 writing process summary:

- pre-drafting
	- Paper 2 general topic proposal: choose a topic of interest related to EP and art (due week 7)
	- Paper 2 academic conversation overview: choose a source argument about that topic (due week 8)
	- Paper 3 source summary: take notes on the source argument to help you write an explanation and analysis of the argument (due week 9)
	- Paper 3 specific proposal: submit a proposal for your final paper thesis (due week 10)
- drafting
	- Paper 2 intro and full outline (due week 11)
	- Paper 2 full draft (due week 12)
		- contextualize the source argument within a larger academic conversation
		- explain the source argument
		- analyze the source argument
		- explain the implications of your analysis
		- (optional) correct the argument
- revision
	- Paper 2 final paper
		- refine the paper thesis, structure, examples, and analysis
		- refine the transitions and sentence-level writing
		- proofread, polish, check formatting

Detailed guidance for each of these steps will be provided in future assignments
