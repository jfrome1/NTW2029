Concision and Wordiness

Make your writing as concise as possible. This maxim does not mean to eliminate nuance or descriptive language. You can often revise sentences to half their length without losing any meaning. A useful, step-by-step method is described here:

> Savage et al. propose three reasons as to why music might facilitate social bonding. The first reason is that when humans behave cooperatively through music-making, they engage in prosocial behaviours which are rewarding to humans and facilitate social bonding (3, 11). Prosocial behaviours refer to behaviours that benefit society as a whole, such as cooperation. Savage et al. claim that there is evidence to suggest that oxytocin levels are elevated in individuals after taking part in music activities. Oxytocin promotes individuals to adopt values and dispositions, such as generosity and trust, that facilitate bonding between individuals (11, 12). Oxytocin is a hormone that is released in the brain, that promotes positive feelings in humans, and plays roles in social bonding. Dunbar et al. (2012) add by suggesting that pleasure derived from music is due to stimulation of parts of the brain that release endorphins and dopamine, which are associated with rewards in humans (689). Within these parts of the brain lie the dopaminergic system, that is active when stimuli such as food are present. Stimuli such as food are associated with the presence of rewards and fitness enhancing environments that humans find to be pleasurable. Similarly, the dopaminergic system is also active during the perception of music, indicating that there is a fitness-enhancing environment present. Therefore, music is perceived to be pleasurable to humans.

	> First and foremost, in concluding that women are more inherently prone to artisticality than men, Varella et al. conducted an extensive review of past research related to art-related skills and behaviours. However, I do not think that the evidence they quoted can allow us to reasonably come to the same conclusion. One example of evidence that they quoted was a book by Ellis et al. (2008), which is a comprehensive meta-analysis of the available literature on sex differences and similarities in humans and other species. Based on the book, females demonstrated stronger preferences for fashion, television, and other forms of art. Other studies were also referenced to highlight this point (e.g., Holahan et al., 1995; Varella et al., 2010), as well as the occupational choices of each sex (e.g., Su, Rounds, & Armstrong, 2009). However, in establishing whether a trait is inherent or learnt over time, we must note the importance of distinguishing between nature versus nurture.
