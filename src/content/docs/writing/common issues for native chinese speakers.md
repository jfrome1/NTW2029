title: Common issues for native Chinese speakers
---

There are several grammar issues commonly faced by native Chinese speakers when writing English (although native English speakers make these mistakes also!). Resources for these issues:

- articles (the, an, a): [How to Use Articles (a/an/the) - Purdue OWL® - Purdue University](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/using_articles.html)
- subject/verb agreement: [Subject/Verb Agreement - Purdue OWL® - Purdue University](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/subject_verb_agreement.html)
- verb tense: [Introduction to Verb Tenses - Purdue OWL® - Purdue University](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/verb_tenses/index.html)
	- NOTE:
		- when writing about source claims, use present tense (e.g.: Boyd states, Pinker notes, Dutton argues)
		- when writing about things that the source refers to as happening in the past, follow the source and use past tense (e.g.: According to Boyd, subjects in the dictator game *divided* the money...)
- plurals: I wasn't able to find any non-basic resources for avoiding mistakes with English plurals; please send me any you have found
