title: Word choice
---

words I've seen SG students commonly misuse by standards of American English

- rationalize: literally means "to give a reason for", but the connotation is "to give a misleading reason or excuse", not "to give a good reason for"
- exemplify: means "to be an example of", not "to provide an example"; e.g. the human tailbone exemplifies vestigial traits, but we don't say that a source exemplifies vestigial traits with the human tailbone

specific words or phrases that are often misused in writing

- like vs such as: https://languagetool.org/insights/post/like-vs-such-as/
- that vs which: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/that_vs_which.html
- i.e. vs e.g.: i.e. means "that is" or "in other words", whereas "e.g." means "for example"
- may vs might:  https://writingexplained.org/may-vs-might-difference (commercial site)
- lay vs lie: https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/how-to-use-lay-and-lie
- the vs a: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/using_articles.html

specific words that you must choose carefully when writing about evolution

- evolve (meaning change over time generally) vs. evolve (in the biological sense of species changing traits over time)
- develop (vs evolve)
- coalition (vs group)
- survival of the fittest: the phrase "survival of the fittest" is usually misunderstood, so if you are writing to a generalist reader, you should not use the phrase as a way to explain evolution, it is more misleading than it is illuminating

specific words that you should try to avoid when writing about art or media due to their ambiguity

- novel (can mean either "different" or a "written fiction narrative")
- frame (can mean either "conceptual approach" or "a photographic element")
