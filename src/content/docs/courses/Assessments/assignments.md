title: Assignments

Assignments include exercises, paper assignments, and papers. Paper assignments are interim assignments like outlines and drafts that lead towards the final papers. Please note the following:

- Assignments are always due at 11:59 pm, after which the assignment is considered late. Proper sleep is important for health (both physical and mental) and I do not want you staying up late doing coursework.
- You may resubmit assignments up until the deadline if you want to make changes. I will read only the final submission.
- Never skip an assignment without communicating with me. If you miss an assignment, write me to explain the lack of on-time submission and suggest a way to move forward.
- All assignments may be used as teaching examples in future classes, with student names removed.
- Even if you have trouble with an assignment or don't know how to do it, submit something. I may not be able to give you credit, but I can at least give you feedback.
- You must complete all paper assignments and papers to a passing standard to pass the course. You can't skip paper assignments and just take a grade penalty; you must complete them, even if they will be late. Optional paper assignments, of course, may be skipped without grade penalty.
