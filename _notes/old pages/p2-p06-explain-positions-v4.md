## Purpose

This assignment helps you build a solid foundation for analyzing the criticism you've chosen. You'll practice explaining scholarly positions accurately and neutrally before forming your own thesis. This explanation will form the basis for your analytical work in P07-P09.

## Overview

Write a 700-1000 word explanation of both the target article's position and the commentary's criticism. Your goal is to help a reader understand what each author argues and how their positions conflict.

Do not include your own thesis or evaluation in this assignment.

## Requirements

Your explanation must include:

1. **Target article context** (1-2 paragraphs): Explain the target article's main argument with enough context for a reader to understand the specific criticism you're analyzing. Focus on what's relevant to your chosen criticism rather than trying to capture every aspect of the article.

2. **The specific claim or aspect** the commentary addresses (1 paragraph): Identify and explain what the commentary is responding to. Quote the target article to show what claim, assumption, approach, or interpretation the commentary criticizes.

3. **The commentary's position** on this claim or aspect (1-2 paragraphs): Explain what the commentary argues about this specific aspect. Quote the commentary to show their main claims and briefly explain their reasoning.

4. **How these positions conflict** (1 paragraph): Explain how and why these positions are incompatible. What makes them contradictory or mutually exclusive?

5. **(Optional) Author's response**: If the target article's authors address this specific criticism in their response, you may include what they say.

### What You Must NOT Include

This is critical: Do not include any of the following in P06:

- Your own thesis or argument about the criticism
- Evaluation of which position is stronger or more correct
- Claims about who is right or wrong
- Analysis of why they disagree or what drives their different conclusions
- Taking sides or signaling which position you find more persuasive

Save these for P07 and later assignments. Your only job in P06 is to explain what each author argues, clearly and accurately.

## Guidelines

### Scope and Focus

Don't try to explain every aspect of the target article. Focus on providing enough context for a reader to understand the specific criticism you're analyzing.

For example: If the commentary challenges empirical evidence, explain the target's main theory briefly, then detail the specific empirical claims at issue.

### Using Evidence

Support your explanation with specific evidence from both texts:

- Quote key claims from both articles
- Use page numbers or paragraph citations
- Explain quotes in your own words to show understanding

### Maintaining Neutrality

Present both positions fairly without signaling which you think is stronger. Avoid language like:

- "The commentary correctly points out..."
- "Unfortunately, the target article fails to..."
- "X makes the stronger argument..."

Instead use neutral attribution:

- "Smith argues that..."
- "The target article claims..."
- "According to the commentary..."

### Thinking Ahead About Sources

As you explain both positions, consider what additional information might help you evaluate the criticism in later assignments. All P2 papers require a minimum of 4 sources (target article, commentary, author's response if applicable, plus at least one additional source).

You might need additional sources if:
- The commentary cites specific studies or data as evidence
- Both positions rely on theoretical frameworks you don't fully understand
- The commentary references the target author's other work
- Claims in the disagreement require verification or context you don't currently have

Note any information gaps or questions that arise as you work on P06. Come to your conference prepared to discuss what sources (if any) would be most useful for evaluating your specific criticism. This will make the conference more productive and help you move efficiently into P07.

Remember: Additional sources should help you evaluate claims in this disagreement, not introduce entirely new arguments or criticisms.

### Organization

Consider this basic structure:

1. Brief overview of target article's main argument
2. Identify the specific aspect the commentary addresses
3. Explain the commentary's criticism of this aspect
4. Clarify how these positions conflict

You may adjust this order if a different organization works better for your specific criticism.

### The Bigger Picture

Your job here is to build the foundation for your analysis. In P07, you'll develop an analytical thesis about what makes these positions incompatible. In P08, you'll discuss the significance of your analysis. But first, you need to understand both positions deeply.

This is similar to P1's process: your thesis should be the RESULT of your analysis, not what motivates it from the start.

## Checklist

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist can remind you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it is not a comprehensive summary of all assignment requirements.

- [ ] 700-1000 words
- [ ] Explains target article's main argument with enough context
- [ ] Identifies and explains specific claim/aspect commentary addresses
- [ ] Explains commentary's position with quotes and reasoning
- [ ] Explains how positions conflict
- [ ] Uses quotes from both articles with citations
- [ ] Maintains neutral tone throughout
- [ ] Contains NO thesis or evaluation
- [ ] Contains NO claims about who is right or wrong
- [ ] Contains NO analysis of why they disagree

## Feedback

You'll receive a conference after submitting P06. The conference will verify your understanding is accurate, identify any additional sources you might need, preview analytical options for P07, and ensure you're ready to develop your thesis.
