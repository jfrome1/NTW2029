## Purpose

This assignment helps you build a solid foundation for analyzing the criticism you've chosen. You'll practice explaining scholarly positions accurately and neutrally, which is essential before forming your own thesis. This explanation will form the basis for your analytical work in P07-P09.

## Overview

Write a 700-1000 word explanation of both the target article's position and the commentary's criticism. Your goal is to help a reader understand what each author argues and how their positions conflict. Do not include your own thesis or evaluation of which position is stronger.

## Requirements

Your explanation must include:

1. **Target article context** (1-2 paragraphs): Explain the target article's main argument with enough context for a reader to understand the specific criticism you're analyzing. Focus on what's relevant to your chosen criticism rather than trying to capture every aspect of the article.

2. **The specific claim or aspect** the commentary addresses (1 paragraph): Identify and explain what the commentary is responding to. Quote the target article to show what claim, assumption, approach, or interpretation the commentary criticizes.

3. **The commentary's position** on this claim or aspect (1-2 paragraphs): Explain what the commentary argues about this specific aspect. Quote the commentary to show their main claims and briefly explain their reasoning.

4. **How these positions conflict** (1 paragraph): Explain how and why these positions are incompatible. What makes them contradictory or mutually exclusive?

5. **(Optional) Author's response**: If the target article's authors address this specific criticism in their response, you may include what they say.

### What NOT to Include

Do not include:

- Your own thesis or argument
- Evaluation of which position is stronger
- Claims about who is right or wrong
- Analysis of why they disagree (save this for P07)

Your job here is only to explain what each author argues, clearly and accurately.

## Guidelines

### Scope and Focus

Don't try to explain every aspect of the target article. Focus on providing enough context for a reader to understand the specific criticism you're analyzing.

For example: If the commentary challenges empirical evidence, explain the target's main theory briefly, then detail the specific empirical claims at issue.

### Using Evidence

Support your explanation with specific evidence from both texts:

- Quote key claims from both articles
- Use page numbers or paragraph citations
- Explain quotes in your own words to show understanding

### Maintaining Neutrality

Present both positions fairly without signaling which you think is stronger. Avoid language like:

- "The commentary correctly points out..."
- "Unfortunately, the target article fails to..."
- "X makes the stronger argument..."

Instead use neutral attribution:

- "Smith argues that..."
- "The target article claims..."
- "According to the commentary..."

### Organization

Consider this basic structure:

1. Brief overview of target article's main argument
2. Identify the specific aspect the commentary addresses
3. Explain the commentary's criticism of this aspect
4. Clarify how these positions conflict

You may adjust this order if a different organization works better for your specific criticism.

### Remember the Process

Your job is to build the foundation for your analysis. In P07, you'll develop an analytical thesis about what makes these positions incompatible. In P08, you'll discuss the significance of your analysis. But first, you need to understand both positions deeply.

## Checklist

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist can remind you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it is not a comprehensive summary of all assignment requirements.

- [ ] 700-1000 words
- [ ] Explains target article's main argument with enough context
- [ ] Identifies and explains specific claim/aspect commentary addresses
- [ ] Explains commentary's position with quotes and reasoning
- [ ] Explains how positions conflict
- [ ] Uses quotes from both articles with citations
- [ ] Maintains neutral tone throughout (no evaluation or thesis)
- [ ] No claims about who is right or wrong

## Feedback

You'll receive a conference after submitting P06. The conference will verify your understanding is accurate, preview analytical options for P07, and ensure you're ready to develop your thesis.
