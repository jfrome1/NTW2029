# Course Design Folder Reorganization Plan v8

**Purpose:** Systematic evaluation of all instruction/context files to identify duplication, conflicts, compliance issues, and improvement opportunities. AI makes recommendations only - user implements changes.

**Created:** 2025-10-21  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** Phase 4 Near Complete - only ai transcript analysis/ remaining

## CRITICAL: AI Role and Limitations

### What AI Does

- **Evaluate files** against criteria documents
- **Identify issues:** duplication, conflicts, outdated content, compliance problems
- **Make recommendations:** what to keep, revise, relocate, or archive
- **Create new versions:** when revisions needed AND sufficient data exists
- **Update tracking:** document all evaluations and recommendations in this file

### What AI Does NOT Do

- **NO moving files or folders** - user handles all file operations
- **NO deleting files** - user decides what to archive
- **NO modifying original files** - only create new versioned copies
- **NO reorganizing folder structure** - only recommend changes
- **NO creating revisions without sufficient data** - must ask user how to proceed if data gaps exist

### User Implements

- Move files to old/ or other folders as recommended
- Delete obsolete versions after verifying new versions
- Update project-ntw2029-course-design-instructions with file changes
- Update Project Knowledge when standard files are revised

## How to Use This Document

### Starting a New Chat Session

When beginning work on this reorganization project:

1. Read this entire document first
2. Check "Progress Tracking" section to see what's been completed
3. Check "Next Actions" section for current task
4. Update "Current Session" with date and task
5. After completing work, update Progress Tracking and Next Actions

### During Work

- Add completed evaluations to Progress Tracking immediately
- Note any discoveries in "Findings & Patterns" section
- Update Next Actions queue as priorities shift
- Document recommendations clearly for user implementation

### Context Transfer

If chat reaches token limit:
1. Update all tracking sections with current status
2. Export chat and save to temp/ folder
3. Start new chat with: "Continue reorganization work from _reorganization_plan.md"

## Evaluation Approach Change (2025-10-22)

**Original approach:** Evaluate all files, document all findings, then revise in batch
**Problem:** Would generate 35,000-50,000 words of documentation (unmanageable)

**New approach (effective immediately):**
- Evaluate file â†’ if needs revision, create v[N+1] immediately
- Document only high-level summary in Progress Tracking table
- Keep "Recommendation" field brief (1-2 sentences)
- Detailed evaluation rationale stays in conversation, not plan document

---

## Current Session

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Task:** Phase 4 - subfolder file evaluations  
**Status:** Completed all folders except ai transcript analysis/ (largest folder, saved for last)  
**Next:** ai transcript analysis/ - many files

## Next Actions

### Immediate

1. Evaluate ai transcript analysis/ folder (many files)
2. Move to Phase 5 after completion

### After Phase 4 Complete

1. Review all findings and recommendations
2. Identify patterns across all evaluations
3. Create prioritized implementation list
4. Generate summary report

### User Implementation Tasks

**Already completed:**
- Moved conversation artifacts to old/
- Moved data-sources-decision-mapping-v1.md to research reports/
- Updated folder guide
- Reviewed and confirmed v2 revision of student-feedback-refinement-instructions

**Pending (user decides when):**
- Move transcript_analysis/ to old/
- Delete obsolete v1/v2 files after confirming new versions work
- Update project instructions if qti-conversion-instructions path changes
- Update Project Knowledge when standard files are revised
- Archive grading papers conversation artifacts (challenges.md, original efficient methods)
- Review temp/ folder for superseded versions and files needing permanent homes
- Optionally provide data for full revisions of files with data gap notes (custom Instructions, feedback-summary-instructions)

---

## Findings & Patterns

### What Worked Well (Phases 1, 3, & 4)

- Files with explicit "When to Use This Document" sections
- Clear cross-references to related documents
- Separation of concerns (technical, pedagogical, student challenges)
- Version history tracking in files
- Scope statements distinguishing file purposes
- Living tracker documents (transcription-patterns-tracker) that evolve with use
- Algorithm specifications as separate reference files (conversion-guide, validation)
- Well-organized reference folders with subdirectories (p1, p2, old/ for archiving)

### Issues Discovered

- Some conversation artifacts mixed with instruction files (Phase 1 - addressed)
- Research/planning documents at root level (Phase 1 - relocated)
- Minor overlaps between context files (handled via cross-references)
- Instruction files missing compliance elements: XML structure, examples, tool specs, success criteria (Phase 4 - being addressed)
- Orchestrator instruction files too brief for reliable execution (qti-conversion-instructions - revised to v3)
- **AI instruction files sometimes lack sufficient data for accurate revision** - solution: add data gap note to v1, defer full revision
- **Conversation transcripts benefit from reorganization** into structured analysis documents (grading feedback audio strategy)
- **temp/ folder accumulates superseded versions** - needs periodic review

### Patterns to Watch For (ai transcript analysis/)

- Workflow files with multiple versions - check for version drift
- Duplicate content across subfolders
- Instruction files not following ai-instruction-writing-guide criteria
- Files in temp/ needing permanent homes
- Outdated references to old workflows
- Brief orchestrator files needing expansion for reliability
- Instruction files needing user input before full revision possible

## Notes

- **Version numbering:** When creating revised files, increment version (v10 â†’ v11)
- **No file operations:** AI only creates new versions, user moves/deletes files
- **Comprehensive evaluation:** Must check ALL files in ALL subfolders
- **Brief documentation:** Keep Progress Tracking entries to 1-2 sentences
- **Read files:** Always use filesystem tools to actually read files, never assume content
- **Immediate revision:** Create v[N+1] files immediately when issues found AND sufficient data exists
- **Data sufficiency:** When data gaps exist, add note to v1 listing missing data rather than creating incomplete revision
- **Reference vs instruction files:** Algorithm/pseudocode specs are reference documents, don't require ai-instruction-writing-guide compliance
- **Light evaluation for reference folders:** Check for obvious issues, no detailed analysis needed

---

## Version History

- v8: Completed all folders except ai transcript analysis/; evaluated yi fan exchange (27 files), reference folders (p1, p2, 2420 examples, research reports), and temp/ (10 files)
- v7: Added data sufficiency assessment step to evaluation process; AI must verify sufficient data exists before creating revisions; if insufficient, add data gap note to v1; completed grading papers/ folder (5 files), completed post-class feedback processing/ (1 file)
- v6: Completed qti quiz questions folder (4 files), updated tracking table, added pattern about brief orchestrator files
- v5: Updated with Phase 4 progress (refine instructor feedback complete, qti partial), changed evaluation approach to immediate revision with brief documentation
- v4: Added reference documents list, structured output format (3-part assessment), explicit requirement to read files not assume content
- v3: Major revision - clarified AI only makes recommendations, never moves/deletes files; expanded scope to require evaluation of ALL files in ALL subfolders
- v2: Phase 1 complete - all 7 root-level files evaluated, decisions documented
- v1: Initial planning document
