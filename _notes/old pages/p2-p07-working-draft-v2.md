## Purpose

This assignment helps you develop an analytical thesis about the nature of the criticism you've been studying. You'll practice identifying what makes the target and commentary positions incompatible, which is different from evaluating which position is stronger. This draft will receive peer review before you expand it in P08.

## Overview

Write a 1500+ word draft that includes a brief explanation of both positions (condensed from P06) and an analytical thesis about what makes these positions incompatible. Support your thesis with analysis that identifies assumptions, definitional differences, evidence interpretation, or methodological commitments that drive the disagreement.

## Requirements

Your draft must include:

1. **Brief explanation of both positions**: Condense your P06 explanation to provide necessary context. Your reader needs to understand what the target article argues, what the commentary criticizes, and how these positions conflict.

2. **Analytical thesis**: State what makes these positions incompatible. Your thesis should answer: What makes these positions contradictory or mutually exclusive?

3. **Analysis supporting your thesis**: Develop your analytical thesis with specific evidence and reasoning. This might involve identifying unstated assumptions, explaining how definitional differences shape conclusions, analyzing how evidence is interpreted differently, or showing how methodological commitments lead to different conclusions.

### What Your Thesis Should Do

Your thesis should identify WHAT makes the positions incompatible, not evaluate which position is stronger.

**Analytical thesis examples** (appropriate for P07):
- "The disagreement stems from incompatible definitions of emotional engagement that lead to different predictions"
- "The target and commentary focus on different types of causation—sufficient versus necessary conditions—which makes their claims about cooperation incommensurable"
- "The commentary challenges the target's empirical claims, but close examination reveals they're measuring different phenomena"

**Evaluative thesis examples** (NOT appropriate for P07):
- "The commentary's objection fails because..." (picking a side)
- "The commentary provides stronger evidence than the target" (judging)
- "The target's theory better explains the data" (evaluating)

Save evaluative claims for P08-P09, and only if your analysis supports them.

### Analytical Moves You Can Make

To develop your analytical thesis, you might explore:

- What assumptions underlie each position?
- How do definitional or conceptual differences shape their conclusions?
- How do they interpret evidence differently?
- What methodological commitments constrain their possible conclusions?
- What theoretical goals make different approaches useful?

You may discuss related arguments from the commentary if they help answer your analytical question, but maintain focus on understanding what makes the positions incompatible.

### About Depth

The analytical work described above is required for all papers—it's not optional or advanced. What distinguishes stronger papers is the depth and sophistication of this analysis, not its presence. Depth comes from how thoroughly you identify what drives the incompatibility and how well you support your analytical claims with evidence.

## Guidelines

### Developing Your Thesis

Your thesis should emerge from your understanding of both positions. After P06, you understand what each argues. Now ask: What makes these positions incompatible? What assumptions, definitions, or commitments prevent these authors from reaching the same conclusions?

### Using Your P06 Work

Condense your P06 explanation to provide context, but don't simply copy it in full. Your reader needs enough background to understand your analysis, but most of your 1500+ words should develop your analytical thesis.

### Related Arguments

You focused on one main criticism in P04-P06. In P07, you may discuss related arguments from the commentary if they strengthen your analysis of what makes positions incompatible. However, maintain focus on your central analytical question.

### Preparing for Additional Sources

P08 will require 2+ additional sources beyond the target article, commentary, and author's response. Start identifying relevant sources now:

- If the commentary cites research as evidence for its claims, read that research to evaluate whether it supports what the commentary says
- If the commentary or author's response references other work by either author, check whether those sources clarify or complicate the criticism
- If you need to understand theoretical frameworks or technical concepts mentioned in either article, find sources that explain them

Remember: Additional sources should help you evaluate THIS specific criticism. They should not introduce entirely new arguments or shift focus away from the disagreement between your target and commentary.

### Remember the Process

Your thesis should be the RESULT of your analysis of what you've learned about both positions. In P08, you may develop evaluative claims if your analysis supports them, but P07 focuses on understanding what drives the disagreement.

## Peer Review Focus

During peer review, you'll:

- Explain to peers what the commentary's criticism is about
- Get feedback on what's still unclear in your explanation
- Discuss how you understand the incompatibility between positions
- Explore possible ways to evaluate the arguments (for P08)

Your peers will help you think through:
- What's still unclear about either position?
- What do they think makes these positions incompatible?
- What would someone need to know to evaluate these positions?
- What assumptions might be driving the disagreement?

## Checklist

Don't try to save time by using this checklist as a substitute for reading the assignment. The checklist can remind you of some easily-missed aspects of the assignment, but it is not a comprehensive summary of all assignment requirements.

- [ ] 1500+ words
- [ ] Includes condensed explanation of both positions (context from P06)
- [ ] States analytical thesis about what makes positions incompatible
- [ ] Provides analysis supporting thesis (assumptions, definitions, evidence interpretation, methodology)
- [ ] Thesis focuses on understanding incompatibility, not evaluating which is stronger
- [ ] Uses evidence from both articles to support analytical claims
- [ ] Maintains focus on one main criticism with any related arguments supporting analysis
- [ ] No evaluative claims about which position is stronger (save for P08)

## Feedback

You will not receive instructor feedback on P07. Instead, you'll get peer review to help you clarify your thinking before expanding your draft in P08. Use the peer review session to test whether your explanation is clear and to explore analytical options with your peers.
