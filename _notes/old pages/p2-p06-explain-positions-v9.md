## Purpose

This assignment helps you build a solid foundation for analyzing the criticism you've chosen. You'll practice explaining scholarly positions accurately and neutrally before forming your own thesis, developing a critical academic writing skill that applies across disciplines. This explanation will form the basis for your analytical work in P07-P09.

## Overview

Write approximately 700-1000 words explaining both the target article's position and the commentary's criticism. Organize your explanation into sections corresponding to the requirements below. Your goal is to help a reader understand what each article argues and how their positions conflict. Complex criticisms may require additional space; if you are being concise, it's ok to go over if needed.

Do not include your own thesis or evaluation of the positions at this point; focus on explanation.

## Requirements

Your explanation must enable a reader to understand:

1. **What the target argues**: Explain the target article's argument with enough context for a reader to understand the specific criticism you're analyzing.

2. **What the commentary challenges**: Identify and explain what the commentary responds to. Quote the target article to show what claim, assumption, approach, or interpretation the commentary criticizes.

3. **What the commentary argues**: Explain the commentary's position with quotes and reasoning.

4. **Where positions conflict**: Explain that these positions reach incompatible conclusions.

5. **(Optional) Author's response**: If the target article's authors address this specific criticism in their response, you may include what they say.

### What You Must NOT Include

Do not include any of the following in P06:

- No analytical thesis about what makes positions incompatible
- No evaluation of which position is stronger or more correct
- No claims about who is right or wrong
- No analysis of what makes them incompatible (assumptions, definitions, methodological commitments)
- No taking sides or signaling which position you find more persuasive

Save these moves for P07 and later assignments. Your only job in P06 is to explain what each author argues and identify where they conflict.

## Guidelines

### Organization

Use the five numbered requirement headings as section headers in your submission. This structured format ensures you address each requirement and makes it easier to provide targeted feedback in your conference. You'll develop a more integrated essay structure in later stages as you develop your analytical thesis.

### Explaining the Target's Argument (Requirement #1)

Provide whatever context your specific criticism requires. Depending on your criticism, you might focus on:

- The target's overall theoretical framework
- Specific empirical claims or evidence
- Implicit assumptions the target takes for granted
- Methodological approaches or interpretive choices

For example: If the commentary challenges empirical evidence, explain the target's main theory briefly, then detail the specific empirical claims at issue. If the commentary challenges an implicit assumption, explain enough of the target's argument to reveal what it takes for granted.

### Explaining What the Commentary Challenges (Requirement #2)

Show what the target article claims or assumes. For explicit criticisms, quote the target's claim directly. For implicit criticisms, explain what the target takes for granted that the commentary questions.

### Explaining the Commentary's Position (Requirement #3)

Support your explanation with specific evidence from both texts:

- Quote key claims from both articles
- Use page numbers or paragraph citations
- Explain quotes in your own words to show understanding

### Explaining Where Positions Conflict (Requirement #4)

Show that they can't both be correct, but don't yet explain what makes them incompatible—that's the analytical work for P07.

### Allocating Your Space

Don't allocate space equally. Focus your space where the disagreement lives. If the commentary challenges explicit claims, provide brief target context and emphasize the commentary's alternative explanation. If it challenges implicit assumptions, invest space showing what the target takes for granted. If it challenges methodology or interpretation, explain both approaches. The goal is complete understanding, not equal coverage—some requirements may need 400 words, others just 100.

### Maintaining Neutrality

Present both positions fairly without signaling which you think is stronger. Avoid language like:

- "The commentary correctly points out..."
- "Unfortunately, the target article fails to..."
- "X makes the stronger argument..."

Instead use neutral attribution:

- "Smith argues that..."
- "The target article claims..."
- "According to the commentary..."

### Thinking Ahead About Sources

As you explain both positions, consider what additional information might help you evaluate the criticism in later assignments. All P2 papers require a minimum of 4 sources (target article, commentary, author's response if applicable, plus at least one additional source).

You might need additional sources if:

- The commentary cites specific studies or data as evidence
- Both positions rely on theoretical frameworks you don't fully understand
- The commentary references the target author's other work
- Claims in the criticism require verification or context you don't currently have

Note any information gaps or questions that arise as you work on P06. Come to your conference prepared to discuss what sources (if any) would be most useful for evaluating your specific criticism. This will make the conference more productive and help you move efficiently into P07.

Remember: Additional sources should help you evaluate claims in this disagreement, not introduce entirely new arguments or criticisms.

### The Bigger Picture

Your job here is to build the foundation for your analysis. In P07, you'll develop an analytical thesis about what makes these positions incompatible. In P08, you'll discuss the significance of your analysis. But first, you need to understand both positions deeply.

This is similar to P1's process: your thesis should be the RESULT of your analysis, not what motivates it from the start.

## Feedback

You'll receive a conference after submitting P06. The conference will verify your understanding is accurate, identify any additional sources you might need, preview analytical options for P07, and ensure you're ready to develop your thesis.
