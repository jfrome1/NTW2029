## Purpose

This exercise develops your ability to identify criticisms suitable for analysis, locate relevant evidence in source texts, and assess significance. You'll practice reading scholarly commentaries critically and verifying your comprehension before investing time in longer assignments.

## Overview

Answer seven questions about one specific criticism from your chosen commentary.

## Requirements

Copy and paste the questions below into a document, keeping the question numbers, and type your answer below each question. No word count limit, but some questions have sentence limits.

### Questions to Answer

For each question, check the guidelines below before answering. Use in-text citations (page numbers are fine) for both paraphrasing and direct quotations.

---

1. What is the target article's main argument?
2. Pick just one criticism from the commentary article. For this criticism, how does the commentary describe the target article's position?
3. What does the commentary article claim is problematic about the target article's position?
4. Locate the section(s) of the target article that the commentary discusses. Quote or describe what the target says about this topic. If you notice discrepancies between the commentary's characterization and the target's actual content, note them for peer review discussion. [:purpose of this check](#x-purpose-of-this-check)
5. Explain the significance of this criticism in 1-3 sentences. What would be the consequences for the target's argument if the commentary is correct? [:q5 significance](#x-q5-significance)
6. The target article's authors respond to the commentaries as a group. Does their response address this specific criticism? If the authors address this point, what do they say? See [How do I find whether the authors respond to my commentary?](#faq-find-response)
7. Give the reasons and evidence the commentary provides to support their claim. [:q7 connection](#x-q7-connection)

## Guidelines

### Choosing One Criticism

Commentary articles typically make several different arguments about the target article. For P2, you should focus on ONE specific criticism. (You can always expand to other aspects later if needed.)

For example, the Konečni (2017) commentary on Menninghaus et al. addresses multiple topics: (1) treatment of the Paradox of Fiction, (2) neglect of the biological nature of emotions, (3) lack of empirical support, (4) the concept of distancing, and (5) music and emotions. If you chose this commentary, you would need to choose ONE of these to analyze for P2 (but don't choose this one since we discussed it in class).

### Answering the Questions

- For Question 1: Provide a brief overview (3-4 sentences) of the target article's argument. Don't try to capture the details; instead try to give a sense of the general "shape" of the argument, especially as it relates to the existing academic conversation.
- For Question 2: Quote a specific passage where the commentary article describes the target article's position and briefly paraphrase it in your own words (1 sentence max). See [Why do I need to both quote and paraphrase?](#faq-quote-and-paraphrase)
- For Question 3: Quote a specific passage where the commentary article describes what's problematic about the target article and briefly paraphrase the claim in your own words (1 sentence max). Just identify what the commentary claims is problematic, don't explain the reasoning (e.g., your paraphrase might say, "Smith says that the target article misunderstands the concept of 'adaptation'").
- For Question 4: Quote specific passages if the commentary discusses explicit claims or quote the relevant section even if the criticism is about what's missing, unclear, or unspecified in that section.
- For Question 5: Would it mean that we should reject the target's conclusions, or that the theory would need to be clarified, or something else? Give reasons for your position.
- For Question 6: The author's response to all commentaries appears in the same BBS issue, typically after all the individual commentaries. Quote any passages where the authors respond to your criticism and briefly paraphrase any response in your own words. Note: Authors may not address every point a commentary makes—if they don't address your point, just state that.
- For Question 7: Focus on the commentary's reasoning—what evidence or arguments do they provide to back up their claim?

## Feedback

You will receive brief written feedback identifying any clear misunderstandings, plus peer review discussion about whether your chosen criticism is workable.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need to both quote and paraphrase?

The quotation lets me see exactly what the article states without having to search it up myself for every student. The paraphrase helps me see if you are correctly interpreting what the article says.

### How do I find whether the authors respond to my commentary?

To find passages relevant to your specific commentary: (1) Open the file with the target and commentary articles, (2) Search (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) for your commentary author's last name, (3) Read any passages in the author's response where they cite or discuss your commentary.

##### :x purpose of this check

This question verifies you understand what aspect of the target the commentary addresses and catches any obvious misrepresentation before you invest time in P06.

##### :x q5 significance

By "significance," I mean: what would be the consequences for the target article's overall argument if the commentary's criticism is valid?

##### :x q7 connection

You provided the commentary's main claim in Q3. Here, explain the reasoning behind that claim.
