## Purpose

This paper develops your ability to identify and analyze scholarly disagreements in academic conversations. You'll learn how different interpretations of evidence lead to different conclusions and practice evaluating what's at stake in theoretical debates within evolutionary psychology.

## Overview

Write a 2250-2750 word paper that explains and analyzes one specific disagreement between a target article and one of its commentaries. You'll work with one of several provided articles from *Behavioral and Brain Sciences* (BBS), focusing on a limited aspect of the debate rather than the entire article.

## Requirements

### Source Requirements

Choose one target article and one commentary article from the provided options:

**Target Article Options:**

- Dubourg, E., & Baumard, N. (2022). Why imaginary worlds? The psychological foundations and cultural evolution of fictions with imaginary worlds. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 45, e276. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X21000923  [download](/downloads/dubourgWhyImaginaryWorlds2022.pdf)
- Menninghaus, W., Wagner, V., Hanich, J., Wassiliwizky, E., Jacobsen, T., & Koelsch, S. (2017). The Distancing-Embracing model of the enjoyment of negative emotions in art reception. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 40. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X17000309  [download](/downloads/menninghausDistancingEmbracingModelEnjoyment2017.pdf)
- Savage, P. E., Loui, P., Tarr, B., Schachner, A., Glowacki, L., Mithen, S., & Fitch, W. T. (2021). Music as a coevolved system for social bonding. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e59. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20000333
- Mehr, S. A., Krasnow, M. M., Bryant, G. A., & Hagen, E. H. (2021). Origins of music in credible signaling. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 44, e60. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20000345
- Download both music articles and commentaries in one file: [download](/downloads/savage-mehrMusicEvolution.pdf)

Use at least four sources total: the target article, the commentary, the author's response (if applicable), plus at least one additional academic source.

### Content Requirements

All papers must provide:

- **Accurate summary** of the target article's overall argument
- **Accurate explanation** of what the commentary challenges in the target's argument (whether explicitly stated or implicitly assumed)
- **Analysis** of what makes them incompatible—different definitions, assumptions, standards for evidence, or interpretations
- **Discussion** of why this disagreement matters for understanding the topic
- **Thesis** stating what you've discovered about the argument's limitations or the disagreement's implications

### Thesis Expectations

Your thesis should emerge from analyzing the disagreement, not precede it.

**Adequate thesis identifies incompatibility:**
"Mehr and Savage disagree because they define adaptation differently."

**Strong thesis reveals what arguments cannot accommodate:**
"Mehr's evidence cannot distinguish evolved traits from cultural diffusion. Without this distinction, universality doesn't establish adaptive function."

### Developing Analytical Depth

Basic analysis identifies explicit disagreements. Stronger analysis reveals underlying structure:

**Making implicit explicit**
- Show unstated assumptions arguments depend on
- Reveal what definitions exclude or prevent from consideration
- Identify taken-for-granted premises

**Independent evaluation**  
- Assess whether cited evidence actually supports the claims made
- Check if counterexamples genuinely challenge the argument
- Verify logical connections between evidence and conclusions

**Revealing constraints**
- Show what questions the framework prevents from arising
- Demonstrate what evidence the approach cannot accommodate
- Explain how methodological choices limit possible conclusions

**Identifying dependencies**
- Explain what the conclusion requires that hasn't been established
- Show cascading problems where one limitation creates others
- Demonstrate multiple independent flaws working together

The strongest analysis doesn't just report disagreement—it reveals what arguments can and cannot do.

### Length and Format

- 2250-2750 words
- Follow all standard paper formatting requirements
- Include proper in-text citations and References section
- Highlight thesis in yellow (2 sentences max)
- Highlight topic sentences in body paragraphs in light blue

## Paper 2 Process

Paper 2 develops through a scaffolded sequence. Each assignment builds toward your final paper:

- **P04: Article Selection** (Week 9) - Choose your target article and commentary
- **P05: Disagreement Summary** (Week 10) - Structured worksheet mapping the disagreement
- **P06: Explain Positions** (Week 10) - 700-1000 word explanation of both positions
- **P07: Working Draft** (Week 11) - 1500+ word draft adding analysis
- **P08: Full Draft** (Week 12) - Complete draft for conference feedback
- **P09: Final Paper** (Week 13) - Revised final paper

See individual assignment pages for detailed instructions and due dates.

## Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. Read the target article for general understanding
2. Read available commentaries to identify interesting disagreements
3. Re-read your chosen passages, focusing on the disputed aspect
4. Map exactly where and how they disagree before writing

Focus on one specific aspect the commentary challenges—not the entire target article.

### Developing Your Analysis

This paper requires different thesis development than Paper 1:

Your thesis should **emerge from your analysis** of the disagreement, not precede it. You cannot know what you'll conclude until you've carefully analyzed both positions and what makes them incompatible.

For example:

**Productive analysis:** "The target's definition excludes cases the commentary presents, revealing a gap in what the theory can explain."

**Premature side-picking:** "I agree with the commentary because their position makes more sense."

The first reveals argument structure through analysis. The second chooses sides without demonstrating why.

### Structure

All papers should include:

- **Introduction** - Orient reader to the disagreement and state thesis
- **Target summary** - Explain overall argument with focus on disputed aspect  
- **Commentary explanation** - What they challenge and why
- **Analysis** - What makes positions incompatible and why it matters
- **Conclusion** - Synthesize implications

These may be one or more paragraphs each, depending on your paper's needs.

## Feedback

You will receive extensive feedback on your P08 full draft during your individual conference. You'll then have approximately five days to revise before submitting your final paper.
