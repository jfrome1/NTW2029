## Purpose

This exercise helps you choose a disagreement suitable for Paper 2. You'll answer questions that:

- ensure you understand what the commentary actually claims
- verify you can locate what the commentary discusses in the target article
- assess whether the disagreement is significant enough for analysis

These checks help catch problems before you invest time in P06.

## Overview

Choose ONE specific argument or disagreement from your commentary article and answer questions about it. Copy and paste the questions below into a document, keeping the question numbers, and type your answer below each question. No word count limit, but some questions have sentence limits.

## Requirements

### Focusing on One Specific Argument

Commentary articles typically make several different arguments about the target article. For P2, you should focus on ONE specific argument or disagreement. (You can always expand to other aspects later if needed.)

For example, the Konečni (2017) commentary on Menninghaus et al. addresses multiple topics: (1) treatment of the Paradox of Fiction, (2) neglect of the biological nature of emotions, (3) lack of empirical support, (4) the concept of distancing, and (5) music and emotions. If you chose this commentary, you would need to choose ONE of these to analyze for P2 (but don't choose this one since we discussed it in class).

### Questions to Answer

Copy and paste these questions into your document and type your answers below each question. For this assignment, use in-text citations (just page numbers are fine in this case) for both paraphrasing and direct quotations.

**For each question, make sure to check the guidelines below before answering.**

---

1. What is the target article's main argument?
2. Pick just one disagreement from the commentary article. For this disagreement, how does the commentary describe the target article's position?
3. What does the commentary article claim is problematic about the target article's position?
4. Locate the section(s) of the target article that the commentary discusses. Quote or describe what the target says about this topic.
5. How significant is this disagreement to the target article's overall argument?
6. The target article's authors respond to the commentaries as a group. Does their response address this specific disagreement? If the authors address this point, what do they say?
7. Briefly explain the commentary's argument about the disagreement.

## Guidelines

### Answering the Questions

- For Question 1: Provide a brief overview (3-4 sentences) of the target article's argument. Don't try to capture the details; instead try to give a sense of the general "shape" of the argument, especially as it relates to the existing academic conversation.
- For Question 2: Quote a specific passage where the commentary article describes the target article's position and briefly paraphrase it in your own words (1 sentence max). [:Why quote and also paraphrase?](#x-why-quote-and-also-paraphrase)
- For Question 3: Quote a specific passage where the commentary article describes what's problematic about the target article and briefly paraphrase the claim in your own words (1 sentence max). For this question, just identify what the commentary claims is problematic, don't explain the reasoning (e.g., your paraphrase might say, "Smith says that the target article misunderstands the concept of 'adaptation'").
- For Question 4: The purpose of this question is to verify you understand what aspect of the target the commentary addresses and to catch any obvious misrepresentation. Quote specific passages if the commentary discusses explicit claims or quote the relevant section even if the criticism is about what's missing, unclear, or unspecified in that section. If the commentary's characterization seems inconsistent with what you find in the target, note the discrepancy and bring it to peer review to discuss whether this disagreement will work for P2.
- For Question 5: In other words, if the commentary is correct, what would that mean for the target article's argument? Would it mean that we should reject its conclusions, or that the theory would need to be clarified, or something else? Explain this significance in 1-3 sentences, giving reasons for your position.
- For Question 6: The author's response to all commentaries appears in the same BBS issue, typically after all the individual commentaries. Quote any passages where the authors respond to your disagreement and briefly paraphrase any response in your own words. Note: Authors may not address every point a commentary makes—if they don't address your point, just state that. [:How do I find whether the authors respond?](#x-how-do-I-find-whether-the-authors-respond)
- For Question 7: You provided the commentary's main disagreement claim in Q3. Here, give the reasons and evidence the commentary provides to support their claim.

## Feedback

The main goal of this assignment is to guide you through checks for comprehension and significance, not to demonstrate skills that require nuanced feedback. However, I will provide brief written feedback indicating whether I see any clear misunderstandings of the texts in your answers.

You'll also discuss your P05 responses during peer review, which gives you a chance to get input on whether your chosen disagreement seems workable for P2.

##### :x Why quote and also paraphrase?

The quotation lets me see exactly what the article states without having to search it up myself for every student. The paraphrase helps me see if you are correctly interpreting what the article says.

##### :x How do I find whether the authors respond?

To find passages relevant to your specific commentary: (1) Open the file with the target and commentary articles, (2) Search (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) for your commentary author's last name, (3) Read any passages in the author's response where they cite or discuss your commentary.
